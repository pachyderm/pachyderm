# Spout Pipelines (Python)

This example is a reproduction of the Spouts101 example from the Pachyderm repo. This example uses the pachyderm-sdk analogs for creating pipelines (`spout.py`), which was done using `pachctl` commands in the Spouts101 example. For more information on Spouts, a full walkthrough of the original example, or the pipelines' user code, go *[here](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/spouts/spout101)*.

**Prerequisites:**
- A running [Pachyderm cluster](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/get-started/)
- Install the latest package of pachyderm-sdk

**To run:**
```shell
$ python spout.py
```

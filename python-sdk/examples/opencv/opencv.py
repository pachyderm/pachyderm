"""
This is a reproduction of pachyderm's opencv example in python.
A walk-through is available in the pachyderm docs:
  https://docs.pachyderm.io/en/latest/getting_started/beginner_tutorial.html

It makes heavy use of python_pachyderm's higher-level utility functionality
 (`create_python_pipeline`, `put_files`), as well as more run-of-the-mill
 functionality (`create_repo`, `create_pipeline`).

# Distributed Image Processing with OpenCV and Python Pachyderm

This is a reproduction of Pachyderm's opencv example in python. A walkthrough is available in the Pachyderm *[docs](https://docs.pachyderm.io/en/latest/getting_started/beginner_tutorial.html)*

This example showcases the python-pachyderm analogs of common `pachctl` commands, such as creating repos and pipelines or getting a file.

**Prerequisites:**
- A workspace on [Pachyderm Hub](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/hub/hub_getting_started/) (recommended) or Pachyderm running [locally](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/getting_started/local_installation/)

**To run:**
```shell
$ python opencv.py
```

# Contributing Guide

## Getting Started
We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to both manage dependencies
  and publish this package. You can find information about installing this
  software [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

Once both `poetry` is installed, you can use `poetry` to create your
  virtual environment for this project. The following command
  (run at the root of this project) will create a virtual environment
  within the `.venv` directory:
```bash
poetry install
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```

## Testing
To execute the tests, run the following command:
```bash
poetry run pytest -vvv tests
```

Setting the following environment variables is needed for all the tests
to run properly:
* PACH_PYTHON_TEST_HOST - Hostname to your pachyderm cluster
* PACH_PYTHON_TEST_PORT - Port over which to connect to you pachyderm cluster
* PACH_PYTHON_TEST_PORT_ENTERPRISE - Port over which to connect to your enterprise-enabled cluster
* PACH_PYTHON_AUTH_TOKEN - Auth token for your enterprise cluster (found in .pachyderm/config.json)

## Releasing
Releasing the package is done through CircleCI.
In the event you need to cut a manual release, you need to set the proper package version
  in the pyproject.toml file and then run the following command:
```bash
poetry publish --build
```
The above command will prompt the user for a PyPI username/password.

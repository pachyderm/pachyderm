# Concepts

Pachyderm is an enterprise-grade, open-source data science platform that
makes explainable, repeatable, and scalable Machine Learning (ML) and
Artificial Intelligence (AI) a reality. The Pachyderm platform brings
together version control for data with the tools to build scalable
end-to-end ML/AI pipelines while empowering users to develop their
code in any language, framework, or tool of their choice. Pachyderm
has been proven to be the ideal foundation for teams looking to
use ML and AI to solve real-world problems reliably.

The Pachyderm platform includes the following main components:

- Pachyderm File System (PFS)
- Pachyderm pipelines

To start, you need to understand the foundational concepts of Pachyderm
data versioning and pipeline semantics. After you have a good grasp of
the basics, you can use advanced concepts and features for more
complicated challenges.

This section describes the following Pachyderm concepts:

Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation portal for first time Pachyderm users! We've organized information into three major sections:

:doc:`local_installation`: Get Pachyderm deployed locally on OSX or Linux.

:doc:`beginner_tutorial`: Learn to use Pachdyerm through a quick and simple tutorial.

:doc:`troubleshooting`: Common getting started issues and how to fix them.

# OpenShift

[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) is a popular enterprise Kubernetes distribution.  Pachyderm can run on OpenShift with some additional steps:

### Deploy Pachyderm

1) Make sure that privilege containers are allowed (they are not allowed by default). You can add `priviledged` scc (SecurityContextConstraints) to `pachyderm` service account:

```
oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_NAME>:pachyderm
```

or manually edit `oc edit scc privileged`:

```
users:
- system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_NAME>:pachyderm
```

2) Replace `hostPath` with `emptyDir` in your cluster manifest (Your manifest is generated by the `pachctl deploy ...` command or can be generated manually. To only generate the manifest, run `pachctl deploy ...` with the `--dry-run` flag).

```
      "spec": {
        "volumes": [
          {
            "name": "pach-disk",
            "emptyDir": {}
          }
        ],

 ... <snip>  ...

      "spec": {
        "volumes": [
          {
            "name": "etcd-storage",
            "emptyDir": {}
          }
        ],
```

Please note that `emptyDir` does not persist your data. You need to configure persistent volume or hostPath to persist your data.

3) Deploy Pachyderm manifest you modified.

```
$ oc create -f pachyderm.json
```

You can see the cluster status by using `oc get all` like kubernetes:

```
$ oc get all
NAME             DESIRED          CURRENT       AGE
rc/etcd          1                1             5m
rc/pachd         1                1             5m
NAME             CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
svc/etcd         172.30.170.24    <nodes>       2379/TCP          5m
svc/pachd        172.30.194.202   <nodes>       650/TCP,651/TCP   5m
NAME             READY            STATUS        RESTARTS          AGE
po/etcd-7m5r1    1/1              Running       0                 5m
po/pachd-foq68   1/1              Running       0                 5m
```

### Configure for a Pipeline

1) Add `cluster-reader` and `edit` role to `pachyderm` service account.

```
oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_NAME>:pachyderm
oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_NAME>:pachyderm
```

2) Add the `pachyderm` service account to the pipeline Pod (ReplicationController).

```
oc patch rc pipeline-edges-v1 -p 'spec:
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccount: pachyderm
      serviceAccountName: pachyderm'
```

or manually edit rc `oc edit rc <RC_PIPELINE> -o json`:

```
                   ...
                "dnsPolicy": "ClusterFirst",
                "serviceAccountName": "pachyderm",
                "serviceAccount": "pachyderm",
                "securityContext": {}
                   ...
```

3) Replace `hostPath` with `emptyDir`.

Again, please note that `emptyDir` does not persit your data. You need to configure persistent volume or hostPath to persist.

4) Redeploy the updated Pods.

```
$ oc scale rc pipeline-edges-v1 --replicas=0
$ oc scale rc pipeline-edges-v1 --replicas=4
```

You can see the pipeline pods are running and successful job.

```
$ oc get pod
NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
etcd-kbi4n                1/1       Running   0          1h
pachd-z3b7y               1/1       Running   0          1h
pipeline-edges-v1-28vdj   1/1       Running   0          12s
pipeline-edges-v1-fpa8v   1/1       Running   0          12s
pipeline-edges-v1-mshi0   1/1       Running   0          12s
pipeline-edges-v1-yx2wa   1/1       Running   0          12s

$ pachctl list-job
ID                                   OUTPUT COMMIT                          STARTED        DURATION   RESTART PROGRESS STATE

```

# Deploying Pachyderm - OpenShift

[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) is a popular enterprise Kubernetes distribution.  Pachyderm can run on OpenShift with two additional steps:

1. Make sure that privilege containers are allowed (they are not allowed by default):  `oc edit scc` and set `allowPrivilegedContainer: true` everywhere.
2. Remove `hostPath` everywhere from your cluster manifest (Your manifest is generated by the `pachctl deploy ...` command or can be generated manually. To only generate the manifest, run `pachctl deploy ...` with the `--dry-run` flag).

Problems related to OpenShift deployment are tracked in this issue: https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/issues/336.  If you have additional related questions, please ask them on Pachyderm's [slack channel](https://pachyderm-users.slack.com/messages) or via email support@pachyderm.io.

## ./pachctl job

Docs for jobs.

### Synopsis


Jobs are the basic unit of computation in Pachyderm.

Jobs run a containerized workload over a set of finished input commits.
Creating a job will also create a new repo and a commit in that repo which
contains the output of the job. Unless the job is created with another job as a
parent. If the job is created with a parent it will use the same repo as its
parent job and the commit it creates will use the parent job's commit as a
parent.
If the job fails the commit it creates will not be finished.
The increase the throughput of a job increase the Shard paremeter.

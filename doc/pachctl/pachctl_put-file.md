## ./pachctl put-file

Put a file into the filesystem.

### Synopsis


Put-file supports a number of ways to insert data into pfs:
```sh

# Put data from stdin as repo/branch/path:
$ echo "data" | pachctl put-file repo branch path

# Put data from stding as repo/branch/path and start / finish a new commit on the branch.
$ echo "data" | pachctl put-file -c repo branch path

# Put a file from the local filesystem as repo/branch/path:
$ pachctl put-file repo branch path -f file

# Put a file from the local filesystem as repo/branch/file:
$ pachctl put-file repo branch -f file

# Put the contents of a directory as repo/branch/path/dir/file:
$ pachctl put-file -r repo branch path -f dir

# Put the contents of a directory as repo/branch/dir/file:
$ pachctl put-file -r repo branch -f dir

# Put the data from a URL as repo/branch/path:
$ pachctl put-file repo branch path -f http://host/path

# Put the data from a URL as repo/branch/path:
$ pachctl put-file repo branch -f http://host/path

# Put several files or URLs that are listed in file.
# Files and URLs should be newline delimited.
$ pachctl put-file repo branch -i file

# Put several files or URLs that are listed at URL.
# NOTE this URL can reference local files, so it could cause you to put sensitive
# files into your Pachyderm cluster.
$ pachctl put-file repo branch -i http://host/path

```
NOTE there's a small performance overhead for using a branch name as opposed
to a commit ID in put-file.  In most cases the performance overhead is
negligible, but if you are putting a large number of small files, you might
want to consider using commit IDs directly.


```
./pachctl put-file repo-name branch path/to/file/in/pfs
```

### Options

```
  -c, --commit                    Put file(s) in a new commit.
  -f, --file value                The file to be put, it can be a local file or a URL. (default [-])
  -i, --input-file string         Read filepaths or URLs from a file.  If - is used, paths are read from the standard input.
  -o, --overwrite                 Overwrite the existing content of the file, either from previous commits or previous calls to put-file within this commit.
  -p, --parallelism uint          The maximum number of files that can be uploaded in parallel. (default 10)
  -r, --recursive                 Recursively put the files in a directory.
      --split json                Split the input file into smaller files, subject to the constraints of --target-file-datums and --target-file-bytes. Permissible values are json and `line`.
      --target-file-bytes uint    The target upper bound of the number of bytes that each file contains; needs to be used with --split.
      --target-file-datums uint   The upper bound of the number of datums that each file contains, the last file will contain fewer if the datums don't divide evenly; needs to be used with --split.
```

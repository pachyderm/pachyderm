## ./pachctl subscribe-commit

Print commits as they are created (finished).

### Synopsis


Print commits as they are created in the specified repo and
branch.  By default, all existing commits on the specified branch are
returned first.  A commit is only considered "created" when it's been
finished.

Examples:

```sh

# subscribe to commits in repo "test" on branch "master"
$ pachctl susbcribe-commit test master

# subscribe to commits in repo "test" on branch "master", but only since commit XXX.
$ pachctl subscribe-commit test master --from XXX

# subscribe to commits in repo "test" on branch "master", but only for new
# commits created from now on.
$ pachctl subscribe-commit test master --new

```

```
./pachctl subscribe-commit repo branch
```

### Options

```
      --from string   subscribe to all commits since this commit
      --new           subscribe to only new commits created from now on
      --raw           disable pretty printing, print raw json
```

## ./pachctl deploy google

Deploy a Pachyderm cluster running on GCP.

### Synopsis


Deploy a Pachyderm cluster running on GCP.
NOTE: Pachyderm currently uses PetSets, which are an alpha-stage Kubernetes feature. You must either:
  1) set --deploy-rethink-as-rc (to disable PetSets, and deploy RethinkDB as a single-node application), or
  2) create a GKE alpha cluster (see https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/alpha-clusters)

Arguments are:
  <GCS bucket>: A GCS bucket where Pachyderm will store PFS data.
  <GCE persistent disks>: A comma-separated list of GCE persistent disks, one per rethink shard (see --rethink-shards).
  <size of disks>: Size of GCE persistent disks in GB (assumed to all be the same).


```
./pachctl deploy google <GCS bucket> <GCE persistent disks> <size of disks (in GB)>
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --deploy-rethink-as-rc          Deploy RethinkDB as a single-node cluster controlled by kubernetes ReplicationController, instead of a multi-node cluster controlled by a PetSet. This is for compatibility with GKE, which does not publicly support PetSets yet
      --dry-run                       Don't actually deploy pachyderm to Kubernetes, instead just print the manifest.
      --log-level string              The level of log messages to print options are, from least to most verbose: "error", "info", "debug". (default "info")
      --no-metrics                    Don't report user metrics for this command
      --rethink-shards int            The static number of RethinkDB shards (for pfs metadata storage). (default 1)
      --rethinkdb-cache-size string   Size of in-memory cache to use for Pachyderm's RethinkDB instance, e.g. "2G". Size is specified in bytes, with allowed SI suffixes (M, K, G, Mi, Ki, Gi, etc) (default "768M")
  -v, --verbose                       Output verbose logs
```

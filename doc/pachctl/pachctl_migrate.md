## ./pachctl migrate

Migrate the internal state of Pachyderm from one version to another.

### Synopsis


Migrate the internal state of Pachyderm from one version to
another.  Note that most of the time updating Pachyderm doesn't
require a migration.  Refer to the docs for your specific version
to find out if it requires a migration.

It's highly recommended that you only run migrations when there are no
activities in your cluster, e.g. no jobs should be running.

The migration command takes the general form:

$ pachctl migrate --from <FROM_VERSION> --to <TO_VERSION>

If "--from" is not provided, pachctl will attempt to discover the current
version of the cluster.  If "--to" is not provided, pachctl will use the
version of pachctl itself.

Example:

# Migrate Pachyderm from 1.4.8 to 1.5.0
$ pachctl migrate --from 1.4.8 --to 1.5.0


```
./pachctl migrate
```

### Options

```
      --from string        The current version of the cluster.  If not specified, pachctl will attempt to discover the version of the cluster.
      --namespace string   The kubernetes namespace under which Pachyderm is deployed. (default "default")
      --to string          The version of Pachyderm to migrate to.  If not specified, pachctl will use its own version.
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

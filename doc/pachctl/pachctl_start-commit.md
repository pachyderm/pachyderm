## ./pachctl start-commit

Start a new commit.

### Synopsis


Start a new commit with parent-commit as the parent, or start a commit on the given branch; if the branch does not exist, it will be created.

Examples:

```sh

# Start a new commit in repo "test" that's not on any branch
$ pachctl start-commit test

# Start a commit in repo "test" on branch "master"
$ pachctl start-commit test master

# Start a commit with "master" as the parent in repo "test", on a new branch "patch"; essentially a fork.
$ pachctl start-commit test patch -p master

# Start a commit with XXX as the parent in repo "test", not on any branch
$ pachctl start-commit test -p XXX

```

```
./pachctl start-commit repo-name [branch]
```

### Options

```
  -p, --parent string   The parent of the new commit, unneeded if branch is specified and you want to use the previous head of the branch as the parent.
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --no-metrics   Don't report user metrics for this command
  -v, --verbose      Output verbose logs
```

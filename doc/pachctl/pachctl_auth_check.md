## ./pachctl auth check

Check whether you have reader/writer/etc-level access to 'repo'

### Synopsis


Check whether you have reader/writer/etc-level access to 'repo'. For example, 'pachctl auth check reader private-data' prints "true" if the you have at least "reader" access to the repo "private-data" (you could be a reader, writer, or owner). Unlike `pachctl get-acl`, you do not need to have access to 'repo' to discover your own acess level.

```
./pachctl auth check (none|reader|writer|owner) repo
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

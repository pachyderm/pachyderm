# Join Input

A join is a special type of pipeline input that enables you to combine
files that reside in separate Pachyderm repositories and match a
particular naming pattern. The join operator must be used in combination
with a [glob pattern](../datum/glob-pattern.md) that reflects a specific naming convention.
Note that in Pachyderm, matches are made on file paths
only, not the files' content. 

Pachyderm supports two types of joins: 

- A default join setting, similar to a database *equi-join*
or *inner-join* operation. Unlike the [cross input](../datum/cross-union.md),
which creates datums from every combination of files in each input repository, 
inner joins **only create datums where there is a *match***. 
You can use inner joins to combine data from different Pachyderm repositories
and ensure that only specific files from
each repo are processed together. 
If Pachyderm does not find any matching files, you get a zero-[datum](../datum/index.md) job.
- Pachyderm also supports a join close to a database `outer-join`,
allowing you to **create datums for all files in a repo, even if there is no match**. 
The `outer-join` behavior can be set on any repository in your join.

When you configure a join input (inner or outer), you must specify a glob pattern that
includes a capture group. The capture group defines the specific string in
the file path that is used to match files in other joined repos.
Capture groups work analogously to the [regex capture group](https://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html).
You define the capture group inside parenthesis. Capture groups are numbered
from left to right and can also be nested within each other. Numbering for
nested capture groups is based on their opening parenthesis.

Below you can find a few examples of applying a glob pattern with a capture
group to a file path. For example, if you have the following file path:

```shell
/foo/bar-123/ABC.txt
```

The following glob patterns in a joint input create the
following capture groups:

| Regular expression  | Capture groups           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/(*)`              | `foo`                    |
| `/*/bar-(*)`        | `123`                    |
| `/(*)/*/(??)*.txt`  | Capture group 1: `foo`, capture group 2: `AB`. |
| `/*/(bar-(123))/*`  | Capture group 1: `bar-123`, capture group 2: `123`. |


Also, joins require you to specify a [replacement group](https://www.regular-expressions.info/replacebackref.html)
in the `join_on` parameter to define which capture groups you want to try
to match.

For example, `$1` indicates that you want Pachyderm to match based on
capture group `1`. Similarly, `$2` matches the capture group `2`.
`$1$2` means that it must match both capture groups `1` and `2`.

See the full `join` input configuration in the [pipeline specification](../../../reference/pipeline_spec.md).

You can test your glob pattern and capture groups by using the
`pachctl list datum -f <your_pipeline_spec.json>` command as described in
[List Datum](../../datum/glob-pattern/#test-your-datums).

## Inner Join
Per default, a join input has an `inner-join` behavior.

### Inner Join Example

For example, you have two repositories. One with sensor readings
and the other with parameters. The repositories have the following
structures:

* `readings` repo:

   ```shell
   ├── ID1234
       ├── file1.txt
       ├── file2.txt
       ├── file3.txt
       ├── file4.txt
       ├── file5.txt
   ```

* `parameters` repo:

   ```shell
   ├── file1.txt
   ├── file2.txt
   ├── file3.txt
   ├── file4.txt
   ├── file5.txt
   ├── file6.txt
   ├── file7.txt
   ├── file8.txt
   ```

Pachyderm runs your code only on the pairs of files that match
the glob pattern and capture groups.

The following example shows how you can use joins to group
matching IDs:

```json
 {
   "pipeline": {
     "name": "joins"
   },
   "input": {
     "join": [
       {
         "pfs": {
           "repo": "readings",
           "branch": "master",
           "glob": "/*/(*).txt",
           "join_on": "$1"
         }
       },
      {
        "pfs": {
          "repo": "parameters",
          "branch": "master",
          "glob": "/(*).txt",
          "join_on": "$1"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "transform": {
     "cmd": [ "python3", "/joins.py"],
     "image": "joins-example"
   }
 }
```

The glob pattern for the `readings` repository, `/*/(*).txt`, indicates all
matching files in the `ID` sub-directory. In the `parameters` repository,
the glob pattern `/(*).txt` selects all the matching files in the root
directory.
All files with indices from `1` to `5` match. The files
with indices from `6` to `8` do not match. Therefore, you only get five
datums for this job.

To experiment further, see the full [joins example](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/joins).

## Outer Join

Pachyderm also supports outer joins. Outer joins include everything a normal
(inner) join does, and files that didn't match anything. Inputs can be set to
outer semantics independently. So while there isn't an explicit notion of
"left" or "right" outer joins, you can still get those semantics, and even
extend them to multiway joins.

### Outer Join Example

Building off the example above, notice that there are 3 files in the
`parameters` repo, `file6.txt`, `file7.txt` and `file8.txt`, which don't match
any files in the `readings` repo. In a normal join those files are simply
omitted, but if you still want to see them without a match you can use an outer
join. The change to the pipeline spec is quite simple:

```json
 {
   "pipeline": {
     "name": "joins"
   },
   "input": {
     "join": [
       {
         "pfs": {
           "repo": "readings",
           "branch": "master",
           "glob": "/*/(*).txt",
           "join_on": "$1"
         }
       },
      {
        "pfs": {
          "repo": "parameters",
          "branch": "master",
          "glob": "/(*).txt",
          "join_on": "$1",
          "outer_join": true
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "transform": {
     "cmd": [ "python3", "/joins.py"],
     "image": "joins-example"
   }
 }
```

Your code will still see the joined pairs that it saw before. In addition to
those five datums your code will also see three new ones, one for each of the
parameter files which didn't have a match. Note that this means your code needs
to not crash when only some of the inputs are represented under `/pfs`.

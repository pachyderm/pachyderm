# Use Transactions

!!! note "TL;DR"
    Use transactions to run multiple Pachyderm commands
    simultaneously in one job run.

A transaction is a Pachyderm operation that enables you to **create
a collection of Pachyderm commands and execute them concurrently**.
Regular Pachyderm operations, that are not in a transaction, are
executed one after another. However, when you need
to run multiple commands at the same time, you can use transactions.
This functionality is useful in particular for pipelines with multiple
inputs. If you need to update two or more input repos, you might not want
pipeline jobs for each state change. You can issue a transaction
to start commits in each of the input repos, which puts them both in
the same [global commit](../../../concepts/advanced-concepts/globalID/), creating a single downstream commit 
in the pipeline repo. After the transaction, you
can put files and finish the commits at will, and **the pipeline job
will run once all the input commits have been finished**.

## Start and Finish Transaction Demarcations


!!! Important "Preamble"
    A transaction demarcation initializes some transactional behavior before the demarcated area begins, then ends that transactional behavior when the demarcated area ends. You should see those demarcations as a declaration of the group of commands that will be treated together as a single coherent operation.


* To start a transaction demarcation, run the following command:

    ```shell
    pachctl start transaction
    ```

    **System Response:**

    ```shell
    Started new transaction: 7a81eab5e6c6430aa5c01deb06852ca5
    ```

    This command generates a transaction object in the cluster and saves
    its ID in the local Pachyderm configuration file. By default, this file
    is stored at `~/.pachyderm/config.json`.

    !!! example
          ```json hl_lines="9"
          {
            "user_id": "b4fe4317-be21-4836-824f-6661c68b8fba",
            "v2": {
              "active_context": "local-2",
              "contexts": {
                "default": {},
                "local-2": {
                  "source": 3,
                  "active_transaction": "7a81eab5e6c6430aa5c01deb06852ca5",
                  "cluster_name": "minikube",
                  "auth_info": "minikube",
                  "namespace": "default"
                },
          ```

  
    After you start a transaction demarcation, you can add [supported commands (i.e., transactional commands)](#supported-operations), such
    as `pachctl start commit`, `pachctl create branch` ..., to the
    transaction.  

    All commands that are performed in a transaction are
    queued up and not executed against the actual cluster until you finish
    the transaction. When you finish the transaction, all queued command
    are executed atomically.

* To finish a transaction, run:

    ```shell
    pachctl finish transaction
    ```

    **System Response:**

    ```shell
    Completed transaction with 1 requests: 7a81eab5e6c6430aa5c01deb06852ca5
    ```

    !!! tip "Noteworthy"
          As soon as a commit is started (whether through `start commit` or `put file` without an open commit, or finishing a transaction that contains a start commit), a new [**global commit** as well as a **global job**](../../../concepts/advanced-concepts/globalID/#definition) is created. All open commits are in a `started` state, each of the pipeline jobs created is `running`, and the workers waiting for the commit(s) to be closed to process the data. In other words, your changes will only be applied when you close the commits.
        
          In the case of a transaction, the workers will wait until all of the input commits are finished to process them in one batch. All of those commits and jobs will be part of the same global commit/job and share the same globalID (**`Transaction ID`**). Without a transaction, each commit would trigger its own separate job.


      We have used the [inner join pipeline](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/2.0.x/examples/joins){target=_blank} in our joins example to illustrate the difference between no transaction and the use a transaction, all other things being equal. Make sure to follow the example README if you want to run those pachctl commands yourself.

      ![Tx vs no Tx](../../images/flow-control-with-and-without-trx.png)
        
    !!! Note "Important"
          Note that in the case with the transaction, the `put file` and following `finish commit` are happening **after** the `finish transaction` instruction.
          You must finish your transaction before putting files in the corresponding repo for the data to be 
          part of the same batch. Running a 'put file' before closing the transaction would result in a commit being created 
          independently from the transaction itself and a job to run on that commit.

## Supported Operations

While there is a transaction object in the Pachyderm configuration
file, all supported API requests append the request to the
transaction instead of running directly. These supported commands include:

```shell
create repo
delete repo
update repo
start commit
finish commit
squash commit
create branch
delete branch
create pipeline
update pipeline
edit pipeline
```

Each time you add a command to a transaction, Pachyderm validates the
transaction against the current state of the cluster metadata and obtains
any return values, which is important for such commands as
`start commit`. If validation fails for any reason, Pachyderm does
not add the operation to the transaction. If the transaction has been
invalidated by changing the cluster state, you must delete the transaction
and start over, taking into account the new state of the cluster.
From a command-line perspective, these commands work identically within
a transaction as without. The only differences are that you do not apply
your changes until you run `finish transaction`, and Pachyderm logs a message
to `stderr` to indicate that the command was placed
in a transaction rather than run directly.

## Other Transaction Commands
Other supported commands for transactions include:

| Command      | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| pachctl list transaction| List all unfinished transactions available in the Pachyderm cluster. |
| pachctl stop transaction | Remove the currently active transaction from the local Pachyderm config file. The transaction remains in the Pachyderm cluster and can be resumed later. |
| pachctl resume transaction | Set an already-existing transaction as the active transaction in the local Pachyderm config file. |
| pachctl delete transaction | Deletes a transaction from the Pachyderm cluster. |
| pachctl inspect transaction | Provides detailed information about an existing transaction, including which operations it will perform. By default, displays information about the current transaction. If you specify a transaction ID, displays information about the corresponding transaction. |

## Multiple Opened Transactions

Some systems have a notion of *nested* transactions. That is when you
open transactions within an already opened transaction. In such systems, the
operations added to the subsequent transactions are not executed
until all the nested transactions and the main transaction are finished.

Pachyderm does not support such behavior. Instead, when you open a
transaction, the transaction ID is written to the Pachyderm configuration
file. If you begin another transaction while the first one is open, Pachyderm
returns an error.

Every time you add a command to a transaction,
Pachyderm creates a blueprint of the commit and verifies that the
command is valid. However, one transaction can invalidate another.
In this case, a transaction that is closed first takes precedence
over the other. For example, if two transactions create a repository
with the same name, the one that is executed first results in the
creation of the repository, and the other results in error.
## Use Cases

Pachyderm users implement transactions to their own workflows finding
unique ways to benefit from this feature, whether it is a small
research team or an enterprise-grade machine learning workflow.

Below are examples of the most commonly employed ways of using transactions.

### Commit to Separate Repositories Simultaneously

For example, you have a Pachyderm pipeline with two input
repositories. One repository includes training `data` and the
other `parameters` for your machine learning pipeline. If you need
to run specific data against specific parameters, you need to
run your pipeline against specific commits in both repositories.
To achieve this, you need to commit to these repositories
simultaneously.

If you use a regular Pachyderm workflow, the data is uploaded sequentially,
each time triggering a separate job instead of one job with both commits
of new data. One `put file` operation commits changes to
the data repository and the other updates the parameters repository.
The following animation shows the standard Pachyderm workflow without
a transaction:

![Standard workflow](../../assets/images/transaction_wrong.gif)

In Pachyderm, a pipeline starts as soon as a new commit lands in
a repository. In the diagram above, as soon as `commit 1` is added
to the `data` repository, Pachyderm runs a job for `commit 1` and
`commit 0` in the `parameters` repository. You can also see
that Pachyderm runs the second job and processes `commit 1`
from the `data` repository with the `commit 1` in the `parameters`
repository. In some cases, this is perfectly acceptable solution.
But if your job takes many hours and you are only interested in the
result of the pipeline run with `commit 1` from both repositories,
this approach does not work.

With transactions, you can ensure that only one job triggers with
both the new `data` and `parameters`. The following animation
demonstrates how transactions work:

![Transactions workflow](../../assets/images/transaction_right.gif)

The transaction ensures that a single job runs for the two commits
that were started within the transaction.
While Pachyderm supports some workflows where you can get the
same effect by having both data and parameters in the same repo,
often separating them and using transactions is much more efficient for
organizational and performance reasons.

### Switching from Staging to Master Simultaneously

If you are using [deferred processing](../../../concepts/advanced-concepts/deferred-processing/)
in your repositories because you want to commit your changes frequently
without triggering jobs every time, then transactions can help you
manage deferred processing with multiple inputs. You commit your
changes to the staging branch and
when needed, switch the `HEAD` of your master branch to a commit in the
staging branch. To do this simultaneously, you can use transactions.

For example, you have two repositories `data` and `parameters`, both
of which have a `master` and `staging` branch. You commit your
changes to the staging branch while your pipeline is subscribed to the
master branch. To switch to these branches simultaneously, you can
use transactions like this:

```shell
pachctl start transaction
```

**System Response:**

```shell
Started new transaction: 0d6f0bc337a0493696e382034a2a2055
pachctl pachctl create branch data@master --head staging
Added to transaction: 0d6f0bc337a0493696e382034a2a2055
pachctl create branch parameters@master --head staging
Added to transaction: 0d6f0bc337a0493696e382034a2a2055
pachctl finish transaction
Completed transaction with 2 requests: 0d6f0bc337a0493696e382034a2a2055
```

When you finish the transaction, both repositories switch
to the master branch at the same time which triggers one job to process
those commits together.

### Updating Multiple Pipelines Simultaneously

If you want to change logic or intermediate data formats in your DAG, you 
may need to change multiple pipelines. Performing these changes together
in a transaction can avoid creating jobs with mismatched pipeline versions
and potentially wasting work.

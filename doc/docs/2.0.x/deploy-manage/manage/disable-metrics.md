# Disable Usage Metrics

Pachyderm automatically collects and reports anonymous usage metrics.
These metrics help the Pachyderm team understand how people use
Pachyderm to make it better. If you want opt out of anonymous metrics
collection, disable them by setting the `METRICS` environment variable
to `false` in the `pachd` container.

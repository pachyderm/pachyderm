# Create a Pipeline

A Pachyderm pipeline is a mechanism that automates a machine learning workflow.
A pipeline reads data from one or more input repositories, runs your code, and
places the results into an output repository within the Pachyderm file system.
To create a pipeline, you need to define a pipeline specification in the JSON
or YAML file format.

This is a simple example of a Pachyderm pipeline specification:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "edges"
  },
  "description": "A pipeline that performs image edge detection by using the OpenCV library.",
  "transform": {
    "cmd": [ "python3", "/edges.py" ],
    "image": "pachyderm/opencv"
  },
  "input": {
    "pfs": {
      "repo": "images",
      "glob": "/*"
    }
  }
}
```

At the very minimum, a standard pipeline needs to have a name, a user code
in the `transform` section, and an input
repository with a glob pattern specified. Special types
of pipelines, such as service, cron, and spout,
have other requirements.
For more information, see [Pipelines](../../concepts/pipeline-concepts/pipeline/).

After you have your pipeline spec ready, you need to pass that configuration
to Pachyderm so that it creates a Kubernetes pod or pods that will run your code.

For more information about property fields that you can define in a pipeline,
see [Pipeline Specification](../../reference/pipeline_spec/).

!!! note
    To create a pipeline, you can use either the Pachyderm UI or the CLI.
    This section provides the CLI instructions only. In the UI, follow the
    wizard to create a pipeline.

To create a pipeline, complete the following steps:

1. Create a pipeline specification. For more information, see
[Pipeline Specification](../../reference/pipeline_spec/).

1. Create a pipeline by passing the pipeline configuration to Pachyderm:

   ```shell
   pachctl create pipeline -f <pipeline_spec>
   ```

1. Verify that the Kubernetes pod has been created for the pipeline:

   ```shell
   pachctl list pipeline
   ```

   **System Response:**

   ```shell
   NAME  VERSION INPUT     CREATED       STATE / LAST JOB   DESCRIPTION
   edges 1       images:/* 5 seconds ago running / starting A pipeline that performs image edge detection by using the OpenCV library.
   ```

   You can also run `kubectl` commands to view the pod that has been created:

   ```shell
   kubectl get pod
   ```

   **System Response:**

   ```shell
   NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   dash-676d6cdf6f-lmfc5     2/2     Running   2          17d
   etcd-79ffc76f58-ppf28     1/1     Running   1          17d
   pachd-5485f6ddd-wx8vw     1/1     Running   1          17d
   pipeline-edges-v1-qhd4f   2/2     Running   0          95s
   ```

   You should see a pod named after your pipeline in the list of pods.
   In this case, it is `pipeline-edges-v1-qhd4f`.


## Creating a Pipeline When an Output Repository Already Exists

When you create a pipeline, Pachyderm automatically creates an eponymous output
repository. However, if such a repo already exists, your pipeline will take
over the master branch. The files that were stored in the repo before
will not be in the `HEAD` of the branch. Instead, you might see new files
created by the new pipeline or a message
that the `the branch "master" has no head`. The
contents of the output commit entirely depend on the pipeline code and the
input repository. So if your new pipeline is different from the one that
existed before, it will replace the old files with new ones or there will be
no files until the new pipeline runs at least once. The old files are still
available through the corresponding commit ID.

If you want to completely replace an existing pipeline, you can do so by
following the standard pipeline creation procedure, as described above. However,
if instead, you want to merge the old files with the new files, you could
do so by putting your old files in a separate Pachyderm branch or repo and
creating a [union](../../concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/cross-union/#union-input)
input that combines these two branches or repos.

To access the old files, complete the following steps:

1. View the list of all commits:

   ```shell
   pachctl list commit <repo>@<master>
   ```

1. Then, use the commit ID to access the old files:

   ```shell
   pachctl list file <repo>@<commit_ID>
   ```

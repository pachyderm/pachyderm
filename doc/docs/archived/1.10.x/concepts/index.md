# Concepts

The Pachyderm platform brings
together **version control for data** with the tools to **build scalable end-to-end ML/AI pipelines** while empowering users to develop their
**code in any language**, framework, or tool of their choice. Pachyderm
has been proven to be the ideal foundation for teams looking to
use ML and AI to solve real-world problems in a reliable way.

The Pachyderm platform includes the following main components:

- Pachyderm File System (PFS)
- Pachyderm pipelines

To start, you need to understand the foundational concepts of Pachyderm's
data versioning and pipeline semantics. After you have a good grasp of
the basics, you can use advanced concepts and features for more
complicated challenges.

This section describes the following Pachyderm concepts:

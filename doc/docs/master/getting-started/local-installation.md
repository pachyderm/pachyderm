# Local Installation  
  
This guide covers how you can quickly get started using Pachyderm locally on macOS®, Linux®, or Microsoft® Windows®. To install Pachyderm on Windows, first look at [Deploy Pachyderm on Windows](../wsl-deploy){target=_blank}.

Pachyderm is a data-centric pipeline and data versioning application written in go that runs on top of a Kubernetes cluster. 
A common way to interact with Pachyderm is by using Pachyderm command-line tool `pachctl`, from a terminal window. To check the state of your deployment, you will also need to install `kubectl`, Kubernetes command-line tool. 

Additionally, we will show you how to deploy and access Pachyderm UIs **[JupyterLab Mount Extension](../../how-tos/jupyterlab-extension/){target=_blank}** and **[Console](../../deploy-manage/deploy/console){target=_blank}** on your local cluster. 

Note that each web UI addresses different use cases:

- **JupyterLab Mount Extension** allows you to experiment and explore your data, then build your pipelines' code from your familiar Notebooks.
- **Console** helps you visualize your DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), monitor your pipeline executions, access your logs, and troubleshoot while your pipelines are running.
  
!!! Warning  
      - A local installation is **not designed to be a production  
      environment**. It is meant to help you learn and experiment quickly with Pachyderm.   
      - A local installation is designed for a **single-node cluster**.  
      This cluster uses local storage on disk and does not create  
      Persistent Volumes (PVs). If you want to deploy a production multi-node  
      cluster, follow the instructions for your cloud provider or on-prem  
      installation as described in [Deploy Pachyderm](../../deploy-manage/deploy/).  
      New Kubernetes nodes cannot be added to this single-node cluster.   
  
  
Pachyderm uses `Helm` for all deployments.  

!!! Attention 
    We are now shipping Pachyderm with an **optional embedded proxy** 
    allowing your cluster to expose one single port externally. This deployment setup is optional.
    
    If you choose to deploy Pachyderm with a Proxy, check out our new recommended architecture and [deployment instructions](../deploy-w-proxy/).  

## Prerequisites  

For a successful local deployment of Pachyderm, you will need:  
  
- A [Kubernetes cluster](#setup-a-local-kubernetes-cluster) running on your local environment (pick the virtual machine of your choice):   
      - [Docker Desktop](#using-kubernetes-on-docker-desktop),  
      - [Minikube](#using-minikube)  
      - [Kind](#using-kind)  
      - Oracle® VirtualBox™ 
- [Helm](#install-helm) to deploy Pachyderm on your Kubernetes cluster.  
- [Pachyderm Command Line Interface (`pachctl`)](#install-pachctl) to interact with your Pachyderm cluster.
- [Kubernetes Command Line Interface `kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/){target=_blank} to interact with your underlying Kubernetes cluster.

### Setup A Local Kubernetes Cluster

Pick the virtual machine of your choice.

#### Using Minikube  
  
On your local machine, you can run Pachyderm in a minikube virtual machine.  
Minikube is a tool that creates a single-node Kubernetes cluster. This limited  
installation is sufficient to try basic Pachyderm functionality and complete  
the Beginner Tutorial.  
  
To configure Minikube, follow these steps:  
  
1. Install minikube and VirtualBox in your operating system as described in  
the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/){target=_blank}.    
1. Start `minikube`:  
  
      ```shell  
      minikube start  
      ```  
      Linux users, add this `--driver` flag:
      ```shell
      minikube start --driver=kvm2
      ```
!!! Note
    Any time you want to stop and restart Pachyderm, run `minikube delete`  
    and `minikube start`. Minikube is not meant to be a production environment  
    and does not handle being restarted well without a full wipe.  
  
#### Using Kubernetes on Docker Desktop   
  
You can use Kubernetes on Docker Desktop instead of Minikube on macOS or Linux  
by following these steps:  
  
1. In the Docker Desktop Preferences, enable Kubernetes:  
   ![Docker Desktop Enable K8s](../images/k8s_docker_desktop.png)  
  
2. From the command prompt, confirm that Kubernetes is running:  
   ```shell  
   kubectl get all  
   ```  
   ```  
   NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE  
   service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   5d  
   ```  
  
   * To reset your Kubernetes cluster that runs on Docker Desktop, click  
   the **Reset Kubernetes cluster** button. See image above.   
  
#### Using Kind  
  
1. Install Kind according to its [documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/){target=_blank}.  
  
1. From the command prompt, confirm that Kubernetes is running:  
   ```shell  
   kubectl get all  
   ```  
   ```  
   NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE  
   service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   5d  
   ```  
  
### Install `pachctl`  
  
`pachctl` is a command-line tool that you can use to interact  
with a Pachyderm cluster in your terminal.  
  
1. Run the corresponding steps for your operating system:  
  
      * For macOS, run:  
  
      ```shell  
      brew tap pachyderm/tap && brew install pachyderm/tap/pachctl@{{ config.pach_major_minor_version }}  
      ```  
  
      * For a Debian-based Linux 64-bit or Windows 10 or later running on  
      WSL:  
  
      ```shell  
      curl -o /tmp/pachctl.deb -L https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/download/v{{ config.pach_latest_version }}/pachctl_{{ config.pach_latest_version }}_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i /tmp/pachctl.deb  
      ```  
  
      * For all other Linux flavors:  
  
      ```shell  
      curl -o /tmp/pachctl.tar.gz -L https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/download/v{{ config.pach_latest_version }}/pachctl_{{ config.pach_latest_version }}_linux_amd64.tar.gz && tar -xvf /tmp/pachctl.tar.gz -C /tmp && sudo cp /tmp/pachctl_{{ config.pach_latest_version }}_linux_amd64/pachctl /usr/local/bin  
      ```  
  
1. Verify that installation was successful by running `pachctl version --client-only`:  
  
      ```shell  
      pachctl version --client-only  
      ```  
  
      **System Response:**  
  
      ```shell  
      COMPONENT           VERSION  
      pachctl             {{ config.pach_latest_version }}  
      ```  
  
      If you run `pachctl version` without the flag `--client-only`, the command times  
      out. This is expected behavior because Pachyderm has not been deployed yet (`pachd` is not yet running).  

!!! Tip  
    If you are new to Pachyderm, try [Pachyderm Shell](../../deploy-manage/manage/pachctl-shell/){target=_blank}. This add-on tool suggests `pachctl` commands as you type. It will help you learn Pachyderm's main commands faster.  
  
!!! Note "Architecture"  
      A look at [Pachyderm high-level architecture diagram](../../deploy-manage/#overview)   
      will help you build a mental image of Pachyderm various architectural components.  
  
      For information, you can also check what a production setup looks like in this [infrastructure diagram](../../deploy-manage/deploy/ingress/#deliver-external-traffic-to-pachyderm).  
  
### Install `Helm`  
  
Follow Helm's [installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/){target=_blank}.  
  
## Deploy Pachyderm
  
When done with the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), deploy Pachyderm on your local cluster by following these steps. Your default installation comes with Console (Pachyderm's Web UI).

Additionally, for JupyterLab users,  you can [**install Pachyderm JupyterLab Mount Extension**](#notebooks-users-install-pachyderm-jupyterlab-mount-extension){target=_blank} on your local Pachyderm cluster to experience Pachyderm from your familiar notebooks. 

Note that you can run both Console and JupyterLab on your local installation.
  
* Get the Repo Info:  

    ```shell  
    helm repo add pach https://helm.pachyderm.com  
    helm repo update 
    ```  

* Install Pachyderm:  

!!! Attention  "Request an **Enterprise Key**"
     To request a FREE trial enterprise license key, [click here](../../enterprise){target=_blank}. 

=== "Pachyderm Community Edition (Includes Console)"
      This command will install Pachyderm's latest available GA version with Console Community Edition.

       ```shell  
       helm install --wait --timeout 10m pachd pach/pachyderm --set deployTarget=LOCAL  
       ```    

       Add the following `--set console.enabled=false` to the command above to install without Console.
=== "Enterprise"
      This command will unlock your enterprise features and install Console Enterprise. Note that Console Enterprise requires authentication. By default, **we create a default mock user (username:`admin`, password: `password`)** to [authenticate to Console](../../deploy-manage/deploy/console/#connect-to-console){target=_blank} without having to connect your Identity Provider. 

       - Create a `license.txt` file in which you paste your [Enterprise Key](../../enterprise){target=_blank}.
       - Then, run the following helm command to **install Pachyderm's latest Enterprise Edition**: 
      
        ```shell  
        helm install --wait --timeout 10m pachd pach/pachyderm --set deployTarget=LOCAL  --set pachd.enterpriseLicenseKey=$(cat license.txt) --set console.enabled=true  
        ``` 

!!! Note 
       This installation can take several minutes. Run a quick `helm list --all` in a separate tab to witness the installation happening in the background.

!!! Tip "To uninstall Pachyderm fully"
      Running `helm uninstall pachd` leaves persistent volume claims behind. To wipe your instance clean, run:
      ```shell
      helm uninstall pachd 
      kubectl delete pvc -l suite=pachyderm 
      ```

!!! Info "See Also"
      More [details on Pachyderm's Helm installation](../../deploy-manage/deploy/helm-install/){target=_blank}.

## Check Your Install

Check the status of the Pachyderm pods by periodically
running `kubectl get pods`. When Pachyderm is ready for use,
all Pachyderm pods must be in the **Running** status.

Because Pachyderm needs to pull the Pachyderm Docker images
from DockerHub, it might take a few minutes for the Pachyderm pods status
to change to `Running`.

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

**System Response:**
At a very minimum, you should see the following pods (console depends on your choice above): 

```shell
NAME                                           READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
pod/console-5b67678df6-s4d8c                   1/1     Running     0          2m8s
pod/etcd-0                                     1/1     Running     0          2m8s
pod/pachd-c5848b5c7-zwb8p                      1/1     Running     0          2m8s
pod/pg-bouncer-7b855cb797-jqqpx                1/1     Running     0          2m8s
pod/postgres-0                                 1/1     Running     0          2m8s
```

If you see a few restarts on the `pachd` nodes, that means that
Kubernetes tried to bring up those pods before `etcd` or `postgres` were ready. Therefore,
Kubernetes restarted those pods. Re-run `kubectl get pods`
 
## Connect 'pachctl' To Your Cluster

Assuming your `pachd` is running as shown above,
the easiest way to connect `pachctl` to your local cluster is to use the `port-forward` command.

- To connect to your new Pachyderm instance, run:

      ```shell
      pachctl config import-kube local --overwrite
      pachctl config set active-context local
      ```

- Then:

      ```shell
      pachctl port-forward
      ``` 
      **Background this process in a new tab of your terminal.**

### Verify that `pachctl` and your cluster are connected. 
  
```shell  
pachctl version  
```  

**System Response:**  

```  
COMPONENT           VERSION  
pachctl             {{ config.pach_latest_version }}  
pachd               {{ config.pach_latest_version }}  
```  
You are all set!  

### If You Have Deployed Pachyderm Community Edition

You are ready!
To connect to your Console (Pachyderm UI), point your browser to **`localhost:4000`**.
### If You Have Deployed Pachyderm Enterprise

- To connect to your Console (Pachyderm UI), point your browser to **`localhost:4000`** 
and authenticate using the mock User (username: `admin`, password: `password`).

- Alternatively, you can connect to your Console (Pachyderm UI) directly by
pointing your browser to port `4000` on your minikube IP (run `minikube ip` to retrieve minikube's external IP) or docker desktop IP **`http://<dockerDesktopIdaddress-or-minikube>:4000/`** 
then authenticate using the mock User (username: `admin`, password: `password`).

- To use `pachctl`, you need to run `pachctl auth login` then
authenticate again (to Pachyderm this time) with the mock User (username: `admin`, password: `password`).
## NOTEBOOKS USERS: Install Pachyderm JupyterLab Mount Extension

!!! Note
      You do not need a local Pachyderm cluster already running to install Pachyderm JupyterLab Mount Extension. However, **you need a running cluster to connect your Mount Extension to**; therefore, we recommend that you [install Pachyderm locally](#local-installation) first.

- To install [JupyterHub and the Mount Extension](../../how-tos/jupyterlab-extension/#pachyderm-jupyterlab-mount-extension){target=_blank} on your local cluster,  run the following commands. You will be using our default [`jupyterhub-ext-values.yaml`](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/blob/{{ config.pach_branch }}/etc/helm/examples/jupyterhub-ext-values.yaml){target=_blank}:

      ```shell
      helm repo add jupyterhub https://jupyterhub.github.io/helm-chart/
      helm repo update
      ```
      ```shell
      helm upgrade --cleanup-on-fail \
      --install jupyter jupyterhub/jupyterhub \
      --values https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/{{ config.pach_branch }}/etc/helm/examples/jupyterhub-ext-values.yaml
      ```


- Check the state of your pods `kubectl get all`. Look for the pods `hub-xx` and `proxy-xx`; their state should be `Running`. 
Run the command a couple times if necessary. The image takes some time to pull.
See the example below:

      ```
      pod/hub-6fb9bb5847-ndfwc                       1/1     Running     0             22h
      pod/proxy-57db95fd89-l5pd5                     1/1     Running     0             22h
      ```

- Once your pods are up, in your terminal, run :

      ```shell
      kubectl port-forward svc/proxy-public 8888:80
      ```

      Then 
      ```shell
      kubectl get services | grep -w "pachd " | awk '{print $3}'
      ```
      Note the returned ip address. You will need this cluster IP in a next step.
    
- Point your browser to **`http://localhost:8888`**, and authenticate using any mock User (username: `admin`, password: `password` will do).

- Now that you are in, [click on Pachyderm's Mount Extension icon on the left of your JupyterLab](../../how-tos/jupyterlab-extension/#connect-the-extension-to-your-pachyderm-cluster){target=_blank} to connect your JupyterLab to your Pachyderm cluster.

      Enter `grpc://<your-pachd-cluster-ip-from-the-previous-step>:30650` to login. 

- If Pachyderm was deployed with Enterprise, you will be prompted to login again. Use the same mock User (username: `admin`, password: `password`).

- Verify that your JupyterLab Extension is connected to your cluster. 
From the cell of a notebook, run:

    ```shell
    !pachctl version
    ``` 

    ```  
    COMPONENT           VERSION  
    pachctl             {{ config.pach_latest_version }}  
    pachd               {{ config.pach_latest_version }}  
    ```

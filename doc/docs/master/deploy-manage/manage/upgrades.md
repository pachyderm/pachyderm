# Upgrade Pachyderm

Upgrades between minor releases or patch releases, such as `2.1.0` to version `2.2.0`,
should be seamless.
Therefore, the upgrade procedure is simple and requires little to no downtime.
As a good practice, we recommend that you check the [release notes](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md){target=_blank} before an upgrade to get an understanding of the changes introduced between your current version and your target. 

!!! Warning 
       Do not use these steps to upgrade between major versions as it might result in data corruption.

Complete the following steps to upgrade Pachyderm from one minor release to another.
## 1- Backup Your Cluster

As a general good practice, start with the backup of your cluster as described in the [Backup and Restore](../backup-restore/)
section of this documentation.

## 2- Update Your Helm Values

This phase depends on whether:

- You would like to modify your existing configuration (for example, enter an enterprise key, plug an Identity Provider, reference an Enterprise Server, etc...)
- You are using a built-in PostgreSQL (i.e., You did not create a PostgreSQL Server Instance and are relying on the in-product PostgreSQL provided by Pachyderm for convenience.). 

!!! Warning "Attention users of Pachyderm's built-in PostgreSQL."
      Note that a default password is created during your first installation. **You cannot pass your PostgreSQL credentials in a secret** when using the built-in PostgreSQL. You must retrieve this auto-generated PostgreSQL password, then set the credential back in your values.

      - To **retrieve the autogenerated value**, run:
      ```shell 
      {{"kubectl get secret postgres -o go-template='{{.data.postgresql-password | base64decode }}'"}}` to retrieve the value corresponding to the key `postgresql-password` in the secret `postgres 
      ```
      - To **supply the generated value back**, use the `--set` flag on your helm upgrade command to pass the password back (`--set global.postgresql.postgresqlPassword=<your retrieved password>`) of update your original values.yaml `global.postgresql.postgresqlPassword`. 

In the case of a simple upgrade of version on a cluster using its own PostgreSQL instance, and provided that you do not need to change any additional configuration, no change in the values.yaml should be required. The new version will be directly set in the `helm upgrade` command.
## 3- Upgrade `pachctl` Version
 
 - To update to the latest version of Pachyderm, run the steps below depending on your operating system:
  
      * For macOS, run:  
  
      ```shell  
      brew tap pachyderm/tap && brew install pachyderm/tap/pachctl@{{ config.pach_major_minor_version }}  
      ```  
  
      * For a Debian-based Linux 64-bit or Windows 10 or later running on  
      WSL:  
  
      ```shell  
      curl -o /tmp/pachctl.deb -L https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/download/v{{ config.pach_latest_version }}/pachctl_{{ config.pach_latest_version }}_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i /tmp/pachctl.deb  
      ```  
  
      * For all other Linux flavors:  
  
      ```shell  
      curl -o /tmp/pachctl.tar.gz -L https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/download/v{{ config.pach_latest_version }}/pachctl_{{ config.pach_latest_version }}_linux_amd64.tar.gz && tar -xvf /tmp/pachctl.tar.gz -C /tmp && sudo cp /tmp/pachctl_{{ config.pach_latest_version }}_linux_amd64/pachctl /usr/local/bin  
      ```  

!!! Note
      For a specific target release, specify the targeted major/minor version of `pachctl` for brew and major/minor/patch release for curl in the commands above.


 - Verify that the installation was successful by running `pachctl version --client-only`:  
  
      ```shell  
      pachctl version --client-only  
      ```  
  
      **System Response:**  
  
      ```shell  
      COMPONENT           VERSION  
      pachctl             <This should display the version you installed>  
      ```  

## 4- Helm Upgrade

- Redeploy Pachyderm by running the [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/){target=_blank} command with your updated values.yaml:

      ```shell
      helm repo add pach https://helm.pachyderm.com
      helm repo update
      helm upgrade pachd -f my_pachyderm_values.yaml pach/pachyderm --version <your_chart_version>
      ```

!!! Note 
      Each chart version is associated with a given version of Pachyderm. You will find the list of all available chart versions and their associated version of Pachyderm on [Artifacthub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/pachyderm/pachyderm){target=_blank}.

- The upgrade can take some time. You can run `kubectl get pods` periodically in a separate tab to check the status of the deployment. When Pachyderm is deployed, the command shows all pods as `READY`:

      ```shell
      kubectl get pods
      ```
      Once the pods are up, you should see a pod for `pachd` running 
      (alongside etcd, pg-bouncer, postgres, console etc... depending on your installation). 

      **System response:**

      ```shell
      NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
      pachd-3677268306-9sqm0   1/1       Running   0          4m
      ...
      ```

- Verify that the new version has been deployed:

      ```shell
      pachctl version
      ```

      **System response:**

      ```shell
      COMPONENT           VERSION
      pachctl             {{ config.pach_latest_version }}
      pachd               {{ config.pach_latest_version }}
      ```

      The `pachd` and `pachctl` versions must both match the new version.

## Pachyderm Configuration Values

### Values Used By Pachyderm At Installation/Upgrade Time

In the following table, you will find a list of all the values used by Pachyderm when installing/upgrading a cluster. Some are optional and dependent on your installation choices.

In general, these values can be provided to Pachyderm in two different ways:

- **A - (RECOMMENDED in production) Create your secret(s) ahead of time** 
      
      **Create your secret(s) ahead of your cluster creation** and provide each secret name in your values.yaml at the time of the first installation. 

      For each set, find the secret name field that references your secret in your values.yaml (Column A) and its corresponding Secret Key (First column) in the table below.

!!! Note
      A reminder that if you are using a pre-built PostgreSQL, you will not be able to pre-create a secret holding your password. It will be generated for you during the first installation and must be retrieved and set back at each upgrade.

!!! Note
      When left blank, the `pachd.rooToken` is automatically generated during the first installation of Pachyderm and kept an internal secret. 

- **B - Provide credentials directly in your values.yaml**

    If you do not want to create your secrets right away, you can provide specific  credentials directly in your values.yaml (Column B lists the names of the fields in which you can set those values directly), or put them with a `--set` argument during the installation/upgrade.


|Secret KEY name| <div style="width:290px"> Description </div>| A - Create your secrets ahead <br> of your cluster creation| B - Pass credentials in values.yaml| <div style="width:250px"> C - Corresponding (Pachyderm Secret, Key) in which the values provided in A or B will be injected. See the following `Pachyderm Internal Secrets` section for details.</div>| 
|------------|------------|-----|--------|---------|
|root-token| Root clusterAdmin| pachd.rootTokenSecretName |pachd.rootToken|(pachyderm-auth, rootToken)|
|root-token|Users give this token in their values.yaml when they install a cluster that is under an [Enterprise Server's](../../enterprise/auth/enterprise-server/setup) umbrella.|pachd.enterpriseRootTokenSecretName|pachd.enterpriseRootToken|????|
|postgresql-password|Password to your database|global.postgresql.postgresqlExistingSecretName <br> global.postgresql.postgresqlExistingSecretKey |global.postgresql.postgresqlPassword|(postgres, postgresql-password) , (postgres, postgresql-postgres-password)|
|OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET|Oauth client secret for Console <br> Required if you set Console|console.config.oauthClientSecretSecretName |console.config.oauthClientSecret|(pachyderm-console-secret, OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET)|
|enterprise-license-key|Your enterprise license|pachd.enterpriseLicenseKeySecretName |pachd.enterpriseLicenseKey|(pachyderm-license, enterprise-license-key)|
|pachd-oauth-client-secret| Oauth client secret for pachd| pachd.oauthClientSecretSecretName|pachd.oauthClientSecret|(pachyderm-auth, auth-config)|
|enterprise-secret|Needed if you connect to an enterprise server|pachd.enterpriseSecretSecretName  |pachd.enterpriseSecret| (pachyderm-enterprise, enterprise-secret)  |
|upstream-idps|The list of dex connectors, each containing Oauth client info connecting to an upstream IDP|oidc.upstreamIDPsSecretName|oidc.upstreamIDPs|(pachyderm-identity, upstream-idps)|


### Pachyderm Internal Secrets

In both cases (A and B above), Pachyderm reads the values provided, then injects them into a set of internal secrets. 


!!! Important "Order of operations."
       Note that if no secret name is provided for the fields mentioned in **A** (see table above), Pachyderm will retrieve the dedicated plain-text secret values in the helm values (Column **B**) and populate its internal secrets at the time of the installation/upgrade (Column **C**). 


Find the list of secrets in which your values will be injected in the table below:

|Secret Name  <div style="width:190px"> | Key |	Description <div style="width:290px">|
|---------------------------------|-----|-------------|
|`pachyderm-auth`                 |	- root-token <div> - auth-config <div> - cluster-role-bindings | - Root clusterAdmin token of your cluster. <div> - Pachd oidc config to connect to dex.<div> - [Role Based Access declaration](../../enterprise/auth/authorization/index) at the cluster level. Used to define access control at the cluster level when deploying. For example: Give a specific group `ClusterAdmin` access at once, or give an entire company a default `RepoReader` Access to all repos on this cluster.|
|**`pachyderm-console-secret`**     | OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET | Oauth client secret for Console. Required if you set Console Enterprise. |
|**`pachyderm-deployment-id-secret`** | CLUSTER_DEPLOYMENT_ID | Cluster identifier. |
|**`pachyderm-enterprise`** | enterprise-secret | For internal use. Used as a shared secret between an Enterprise Server and a Cluster to communicate. Always present when enterprise is on but used only when an Enterprise Server is set.|
|`pachyderm-identity` | upstream-idps | The list of dex connectors, each containing Oauth client info connecting to an upstream IDP. |
|`pachyderm-license` | enterprise-license-key | Your enterprise license. |
|`pachyderm-storage-secret` | *This content depends on what object store backs your installation of Pachyderm.*|Credentials for Pachyderm to access your object store.|
|`postgres` | - postgresql-password <div> - postgresql-postgres-password| Password for Pachyderm to Access Postgres |

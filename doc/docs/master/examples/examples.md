## Tutorials
In this section, you will find tutorials focused on a particular concept or a feature. Use them to deepen your understanding of one of those subjects:

### Pipeline Inputs
A pipeline input can have one or multiple [PFS inputs](../../concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/#pfs-input-and-glob-pattern){target=_blank}. In the latter case, Pachyderm provides a variety of options to aggregate several PFS inputs together.

- Inner and Outer Joins Input
A join is a special type of pipeline input that enables you to combine files that reside in separate Pachyderm repositories and match a particular naming pattern.  

[Inner and Outer joins 101 - A simplified retail use case](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/joins){target=_blank}

- Group Input
A group is a special type of pipeline input that enables 
you to group files that reside in one or separate Pachyderm
repositories and match a particular naming pattern. 

[Group 101 - An Introductory example](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/group){target=_blank}
### Spouts

A spout is a special type of pipeline that you can use to ingest
streaming data .

- [Spout101](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/spouts/spout101){target=_blank}

- Advanced -  This is a simple example of using Pachyderm's spouts with RabbitMQ to process messages and write them to files.
This spout reads messages from a single configurable RabbitMQ queue. 
Take a look; there is a little more to it, including a fault tolerance mechanism: [Pachyderm's integration of spouts with RabbitMQ](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/spouts/go-rabbitmq-spout){target=_blank} <sup>`integration`</sup>

### err_cmd

The `err_cmd` parameter in a Pachyderm pipeline enables
you to specified actions for failed datums. When you do not
need all the datums to be successful for each run of your
pipeline, you can configure this parameter to skip them and
mark the job run as successful.

[Skip Failed Datums in Your Pipeline](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/err_cmd){target=_blank}

## Word Count (Map/Reduce)

Word count is basically the "hello world" of distributed computation. This example is great for benchmarking in distributed deployments on large swaths of text data.

[Word Count](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/word_count){target=_blank}

## Lazy Shuffle pipeline

This example demonstrates how lazy shuffle pipeline i.e. a pipeline that shuffles, combines files without downloading/uploading can be created. These types of pipelines are useful for an intermediate processing step that aggregates or rearranges data from one or many sources.

###  S3 gateway 
- Pachyderm - Seldon integration: Version Controlled ModelsÂ¶

    In this example, we showcased how we can integrate Pachyderm's end-to-end pipelines,
    leveraging our data lineage capabilities, 
    with [Seldon-Core's deployment platform of ML models](https://www.seldon.io/tech/products/core/){target=_blank}.

    1. In this first simple example, we train a data-driven model using Pachyderm (LogisticRegression on the Iris dataset with sklearn),
    expose the model's artifacts through Pachyderm's [S3 gateway](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/reference/s3gateway_api/){target=_blank}, and serve this model in production using Seldon-core. https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/blob/master/examples/pachyderm-simple/index.ipynb

        !!! Highlights
            You can trace the model artifact's lineage right back to the version of the data that it was trained on.  

    1. CD for an ML process: In this example, we automate the provisioning of a Seldon deployment using Pachyderm pipelines when new training data enters a Pachyderm repository. 
    https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/blob/master/examples/pachyderm-cd4ml/index.ipynb

        !!! Highlights 
            - **Provenance** - The traceability of the model artifact's lineage all the way to the data provides the ability to do post-analysis on models performing poorly.  
            - **Automation** -  A new deployment in production is triggered when new model artifacts are exposed to Pachyderm's [S3 getaway](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/reference/s3gateway_api/){target=_blank}.

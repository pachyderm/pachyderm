# Notebooks (beta)

!!! Warning
     - Notebooks is a [**beta**](../../../../contributing/supported-releases/#beta) release.
     - Notebooks (Pachyderm IDE) is an enterprise feature. Request your FREE 30-day [**Enterprise Edition trial token**](https://www.pachyderm.com/trial) or create a workspace on our Saas
     solution [Hub](https://hub.pachyderm.com) and experiment with Notebooks right away.

## Overview

Pachyderm Notebooks is a **customized JupyterHub deployment running inside and authenticated to your Pachyderm cluster.**.

The Jupyter notebooks spawned from Notebooks provide data scientists with a familiar way to sample (mount repositories) or experiment with data and code written in Python. 
Because those experiments are running on Pachyderm, Data scientists benefit from the complete reproducibility that data versioning and lineage offer, while ML engineers can productionize those pipelines faster, efficiently, and securely.

## Base Image

Our Notebooks instances come with a pre-installed suite of packages, including:

 - [Jupyter Data science base image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/jupyter/datascience-notebook/python-3.8.8/images/sha256-bab39ddef7f66e05a0618a23abbf8e71cba000a5fff585b515cc3338698ec165?context=explore) with [libraries for data analysis](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-datascience-notebook) from the Python (scipy, scikit-learn, pandas, beautifulsoup, seaborn, matplotlib... ), R, and Julia communities. 
 - Our [Python Client `python-pachyderm`](../../reference/clients/#python-client). 
 - Our Command-Line Tool `pachctl`.

Any additional library can be installed running `pip install` from a cell.

!!! Note 
     We have also included a selection of data science examples running on Pachyderm, from a market sentiment NLP implementation using a FinBERT model to pipelines training a regression model on the Boston Housing Dataset. In the `/examples` directory, you will also find integration examples with opensource products that would complete your ML stack such as labeling or model serving applications.
## Getting Started

!!! Note 
     See the `deploy-manage` section of this documentation to learn how to connect to Notebooks or simply click on the `Notebooks` button of your workspace on [Hub](https://hub.pachyderm.com).


From the landing page of Notebooks, in the `/examples` directory, click on the **Intro to Pachyderm Tutorial**. 
Follow along to learn the basics of Pachyderm (repos, pipelines, commits, etc...) from your familiar Jupyter notebook.

!!! Note 
     This Tutorial uses Pachyderm's CLI `pachctl`. Feel free to use 'python-pachyderm' instead.

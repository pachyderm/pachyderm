# Pipeline Scaling Limits in Community Edition

Our free Pachyderm Community Edition contains **built-in scaling limitations and parallelism thresholds**. To scale beyond these limits, request a [Pachyderm Enterprise trial token](https://www.pachyderm.com/trial/){target=_blank} and enjoy unlimited scaling, and more.

!!! Info "You might qualify for a free Enterprise license." 
    Pachyderm offers activation keys for proofs-of-concept, startups, academic, nonprofit, or open-source projects. [Tell us about your project!](https://www.pachyderm.com/trial/){target=_blank}

## Scaling Limits

|**Number of concurrent pipelines** deployed| **Number of workers** for each pipeline|
|------|------|
|Community Users can deploy **up to 16 pipelines**.| Community Users can run **up to 8 workers in parallel** on each pipeline.|

## What happens when you exceed those limits?

As a general rule, Pachyderm provides **an error message in the STDERR** whenever a limit is encountered that prevents you from successfully running a command. In that case, the alert message links to a free trial request form.

### Limit on the number of pipelines
When exceeding the number of pipelines:

- `pachctl create pipeline` fails once the maximum number of pipelines is reached.

- `pachctl update pipeline`  and `pachctl edit pipeline` succeed on existing pipelines, fail when attempting to create pipelines beyond the limit.

    !!! Note
        If `update pipeline` fails for any other reason, it does not log any message related to pipeline limits.

All of the commands listed above create a distinct message to STDERR and to the pachd logs. This message includes information such as the limit on the number of pipelines in the Community Edition, the total number of pipelines deployed, and provides a link to request an Enterprise key to lift those limitations.  

- all other `list`, `run`, `start`, `stop pipeline` commands' behavior remains unchanged.

### Limit on the number of workers per pipeline
When `constant` parallelism > 8: 

- `pachctl create pipeline` and `pachctl update pipeline` fail. A message to STDERR and pachd logs is generated. You will need to update your pipeline specification file accordingly or activate an Enterprise license.

## What happens when your license expires? 

If your Enterprise License has expired and you have more than 16 pipelines, all existing pipelines **continue to work**. However, **you will not be able to create additional pipelines**. Same behavior if you upgrade your cluster.

!!! Warning
    Restoring or installing Pachyderm with an expired license will fail.

!!! Note
    Pipelines automatically generated by the system (for example cron...) are not considered when assessing the total number of pipelines deployed. The **limit applies to user-created pipelines only**.

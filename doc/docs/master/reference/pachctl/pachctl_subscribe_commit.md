## pachctl subscribe commit

Print commits as they are created (finished).

### Synopsis

Print commits as they are created in the specified repo and branch.  By default, all existing commits on the specified branch are returned first.  A commit is only considered 'created' when it's been finished.

```
pachctl subscribe commit <repo>[@<branch>] [flags]
```

### Examples

```

# subscribe to commits in repo "test" on branch "master"
$ pachctl subscribe commit test@master

# subscribe to commits in repo "test" on branch "master", but only since commit XXX.
$ pachctl subscribe commit test@master --from XXX

# subscribe to commits in repo "test" on branch "master", but only for new commits created from now on.
$ pachctl subscribe commit test@master --new
```

### Options

      --all               return all types of commits, including aliases
      --from string       subscribe to all commits since this commit

      --new               subscribe to only new commits created from now on

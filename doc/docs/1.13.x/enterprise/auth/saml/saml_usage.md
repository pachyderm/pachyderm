# Authentication and Authorization using SAML IDP - An example

## Run pipelines on your cluster as a cluster admin
Before you start, follow the instructions in [Configure SAML](index.md) to enable auth in a
Pachyderm cluster and connect it to a SAML ID provider. 

We will then authenticate as a **cluster admin** in one console and run our [open CV
demo](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/blob/1.13.x/examples/opencv/README.md).

- In the CLI, that would look like:

    ```shell
    $ pachctl auth use-auth-token
    ```

    **System response:**
    ```
    Please paste your Pachyderm auth token:
    <auth token>
    ```

    ```shell
    $ pachctl auth whoami
    ```

    **System response:**
    ```
    You are "robot:admin"
    You are an administrator of this Pachyderm cluster
    ```

- As the **cluster admin**, create a repository, pipelines, and put files into the
repository.

    ```shell
    $ pachctl create repo images
    $ pachctl create pipeline -f examples/opencv/edges.json
    $ pachctl create pipeline -f examples/opencv/montage.json
    $ pachctl put file images@master -i examples/opencv/images.txt
    $ pachctl put file images@master -i examples/opencv/images2.txt
    ```

    View the list of existing repositories:

    ```shell
    $ pachctl list repo
    ```

    **System response:**
    ```
    NAME    CREATED       SIZE (MASTER) ACCESS LEVEL
    montage 2 minutes ago 1.653MiB      OWNER
    edges   2 minutes ago 133.6KiB      OWNER
    images  2 minutes ago 238.3KiB      OWNER
    ```

    ... And the list of jobs:

    ```shell
    $ pachctl list job
    ```

    **System response:**
    ```shell
    ID                               OUTPUT COMMIT                            STARTED       DURATION  RESTART PROGRESS  DL       UL       STATE

## Authenticating via a SAML ID Provider in the dashboard as a non admin user
Before authenticating, navigating to the dash will yield a blank screen:

![Blocked-out dash](../../../assets/images/saml_log_in.png)

Even through the dash suggests logging in via GitHub, we will log in using a
SAML IdP (which has hopefully already been configured). To see your Pachyderm
DAG, navigate to your SAML ID provider and sign in to your Pachyderm cluster.

Once you have authenticated, you will be redirected to the Pachyderm Dash (the
redirect URL is configured in the Pachyderm auth system). You will be given the
opportunity to generate a one-time password (OTP), though you can always do this
later from the settings panel.

![Dash logged in](../../../assets/images/saml_successfully_logged_in.png)

After closing the OTP panel, you will be able to see the Pachyderm DAG, but you
may not have access to any of the repos inside (a repo that you cannot read is
indicated by a lock symbol):

![Dash with locked repos](../../../assets/images/saml_dag.png)

## Authenticating in the CLI as a non admin user
After authenticating in the dash, you will be given the opportunity to generate a
one-time password (OTP) and sign in on the CLI. You can also generate an OTP
from the settings panel:

![OTP Image](../../../assets/images/saml_display_otp.png)

```shell
    $ pachctl auth login --code auth_code:73db4686e3e142508fa74aae920cc58b
    $ pachctl auth whoami
```

**System response:**

```
    You are "saml:msteffen@pachyderm.io"
    session expires: 14 Sep 18 20:55 PDT
```

Note that this session expires after 8 hours. The duration of sessions is
configurable in the Pachyderm auth config, but it is important that they be
relatively short, as SAML group memberships are only updated when users sign in.
If a user is removed from a group, they will still be able to access the group's
resources until their session expires.

## Authorizing a user or group to access data

We will give the example of an **admin granting a user access**. This can be
accomplished on the CLI :

```shell
    $ pachctl auth set saml:msteffen@pachyderm.io reader images
```

Now, the `images` repo is no longer locked when that user views the DAG:

![Unlocked images repo image](../../../assets/images/saml_dag_images_readable.png)

At this point, you can click on the `images` repo and preview data inside:

![Unlocked images repo image](../../../assets/images/saml_dag_reading_from_images.png)

Likewise, you can grant access to repos via **groups**. You will need a SAML ID
provider that supports group attributes, and you will need to put the name of that
attribute in the Pachyderm auth config. Here, we will grant access to the *Everyone*
group:

```shell
    $ pachctl auth set group/saml:Everyone owner edges
```

Now, the edges repo is also not locked:

![Unlocked edges repo](../../../assets/images/saml_dag_images_and_edges_readable.png)

!!! Note
    Because `msteffen@pachyderm.io` has OWNER provileges in the `edges` repo
    (via the *Everyone* group), the ACL for `edges` can be edited.
    `msteffen@pachyderm.io` will use OWNER privileges gained via the Everyone group
    to add `msteffen@pachyderm.io` (the user principal) directly to that ACL:

    ![Adding user to ACL image](../../../assets/images/saml_editing_acl.png)

    This change is reflected in the CLI as well:

    ```shell
        $ pachctl auth get edges
    ```
    **System response:**

    ```
        pipeline:edges: WRITER
        pipeline:montage: READER
        group/saml:Everyone: OWNER
        saml:msteffen@pachyderm.io: READER
        robot:admin: OWNER
    ```

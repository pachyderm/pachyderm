and `OS_ENDPOINT` that are used in the examples below.
1. Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/).
1. Install [pachctl](../../../../getting_started/local_installation/#install-pachctl).
1. Proceed to [Pachyderm Deployment Manifest](../deploy_custom_pachyderm_deployment_manifest/).

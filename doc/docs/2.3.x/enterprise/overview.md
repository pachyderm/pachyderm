## Enterprise Features List

Pachyderm Enterprise Edition helps you scale and manage Pachyderm data pipelines in an enterprise setting.

It delivers the most recent version of the Community Edition of Pachyderm along with additional features(#additioanl-features).

!!! Warning "THE ENTERPRISE EDITION LIFTS **ALL SCALING LIMITATIONS**"
     Note that the activation of the Enterprise Edition [**lifts all scaling limits of the Community Edition**](../../reference/scaling-limits/). You can run as many pipelines as you need and parallelize your jobs without constraints.


### Additional Features

Pachyderm Enterprise unlocks a series of additional administrative and security features needed for enterprise-scale deployments of Pachyderm, namely:

- [**Authentication**](../auth/authentication/idp-dex): Pachyderm allows for authentication **against any OIDC provider**. Users can authenticate to Pachyderm by logging into their favorite Identity Provider. 
- [**Role-Based Access Control - RBAC**](../auth/authorization/): Enterprise-scale deployments require access control.  Pachyderm Enterprise Edition gives teams the ability to control access to production pipelines and data.  Administrators can silo data, prevent unintended modifications to production pipelines, and support multiple data scientists or even multiple data science groups by controlling users' access to Pachyderm resources.
- [**Enterprise Server**](../auth/enterprise-server/setup/): An organization can have **many Pachyderm clusters registered with one single Enterprise Server** that manages the ÃŸEnterprise licensing and the integration with a company's Identity Provider.
- Additionally, you have access to a pachctl command that [pauses (`pachctl enterprise pause`) and unpauses (`pachctl enterprise unpause`) your cluster](../../deploy-manage/manage/backup-restore){target=_blank} for a backup and restore.

### Tooling

Pachyderm CE comes with an indispensable complementary tool 
when designing and debugging pipelines: **Pachyderm Console**; 
a full Web UI for visualizing pipelines and exploring data. 

While Console is now part of Pachyderm Community Edition, 
enabling Enterprise allows you to benefit 
from the full Authentication and Role-Based Access Control capabilities 
by restricting the access to specific resources to authorized users only. 
Unauthorized users will not be able to visualize the content 
of given clusters, repos, and pipelines.

# Create a Pipeline

A Pachyderm pipeline is a mechanism that automates a machine learning workflow.
A pipeline reads data from one or more input repositories, runs your code, and
places the results into an output repository within the Pachyderm file system.
To create a pipeline, you need to define a pipeline specification in the JSON
or YAML file format. Alternatively, you can create a pipeline using [jsonnet pipeline specs](#creating-a-pipeline-using-a-jsonnet-pipeline-specification-file).

This is a simple example of a Pachyderm pipeline specification:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "edges"
  },
  "description": "A pipeline that performs image edge detection by using the OpenCV library.",
  "transform": {
    "cmd": [ "python3", "/edges.py" ],
    "image": "pachyderm/opencv"
  },
  "input": {
    "pfs": {
      "repo": "images",
      "glob": "/*"
    }
  }
}
```

At the very minimum, a standard pipeline needs to have a name, a user code
in the `transform` section, and an input
repository with a glob pattern specified. Special types
of pipelines, such as a service, cron, and spout,
have other requirements.
For more information, see [Pipelines](../../../concepts/pipeline-concepts/pipeline/).

After you have your pipeline spec ready, you need to pass that configuration
to Pachyderm so that it creates a Kubernetes pod or pods that will run your code.

For more information about property fields that you can define in a pipeline,
see [Pipeline Specification](../../../reference/pipeline-spec/).

To create a pipeline, complete the following steps:

1. Create a pipeline specification. For more information, see
[Pipeline Specification](../../../reference/pipeline-spec/).

1. Create a pipeline by passing the pipeline configuration to Pachyderm:

    ```shell
    pachctl create pipeline -f <pipeline_spec>
    ```
    !!! Note
         -  `pachctl create pipeline -f` also accepts an URL.

            For example, in our opencv beginner tutorial:
            ```shell
            pachctl create pipeline -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/master/examples/opencv/edges.json
            ```
         -  `pachctl update pipeline -f` will create the pipeline is it does not exist.
       

1. Verify that the Kubernetes pod has been created for the pipeline:

    ```shell
    pachctl list pipeline
    ```

    **System Response:**

    ```shell
    NAME  VERSION INPUT     CREATED       STATE / LAST JOB   DESCRIPTION
    edges 1       images:/* 5 seconds ago running / starting A pipeline that performs image edge detection by using the OpenCV library.
    ```

    You can also run `kubectl` commands to view the pod that has been created:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod
    ```

    **System Response:**

    ```shell
    NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    pachd-5485f6ddd-wx8vw     1/1     Running   1          17d
    pipeline-edges-v1-qhd4f   2/2     Running   0          95s
    ...
    ```

    You should see a pod named after your pipeline in the list of pods.
    In this case, it is `pipeline-edges-v1-qhd4f`.

## Creating a Pipeline using a Jsonnet Pipeline Specification File

[Jsonnet Pipeline specs](../jsonnet-pipeline-specs/) let you create pipelines while passing a set of parameters dynamically, allowing you to reuse the baseline of a given pipeline while changing the values of chosen fields.
You can, for example, create multiple pipelines out of the same jsonnet pipeline spec file while pointing each of them at different input repositories, parameterize a command line in the transform field of your pipelines, or dynamically pass various docker images to train different models on the same dataset. 

For illustration purposes, in the following example, we are creating a pipeline named `edges-1` and pointing its input repository at the repo 'images':
```shell
pachctl create pipeline --jsonnet jsonnet/edges.jsonnet --arg suffix=1 --arg src=images
```
## Creating a Pipeline When an Output Repository Already Exists

When you create a pipeline, Pachyderm automatically creates an eponymous output
repository. However, if such a repo already exists, your pipeline will take
over the master branch. The files that were stored in the repo before
will still be in the `HEAD` of the branch.

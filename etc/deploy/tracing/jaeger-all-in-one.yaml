# (the head of the 'master' branch as of 2022-12-08T11:45:13-08:00)
# with the following minor changes:
#   - apiVersion of the Jaeger deployment was changed to `apps/v1` (from `extensions/v1beta1`)
#   - jaeger-agent service removed (it's unused--the jaeger-agent receives traces and forwards them
#     to the collector, but our client sends traces directly to the collector. See
#     https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-csharp/issues/104
#     - The associated ports (5775, 5778, 6831, 6832) were all removed from the container as well
#   - The jaeger-collector-tchannel and jaeger-collector-http ports are now exported from the
#     container (AFAICT this manifest doesn't work otherwise--I think it's a bug in the original
#     manifest in github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-kubernetes)
#   - jaeger-collector-zipkin service removed (IIUC, it's likewise unused; I think it's a
#     compatibility feature that we don't need, as we don't have any existing zipkin clients in
#     pachd/pachctl that need to be supported)
#   - container version fixed at 1.39.0
# Maybe also do:
#   - Remove the Zipkin port from collector service
#   - Remove the COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT env var from the container, and remove port 9411
#     from the jaeger-collector service (the zipkin collector port)

# This is the number of GPUs there are per machine. Determined uses this information when scheduling
# multi-GPU tasks. Each multi-GPU (distributed training) task will be scheduled as a set of
# `slotsPerTask / maxSlotsPerPod` separate pods, with each pod assigned up to `maxSlotsPerPod` GPUs.
# Distributed tasks with sizes that are not divisible by `maxSlotsPerPod` are never scheduled. If
# you have a cluster of different size nodes (e.g., 4 and 8 GPUs per node), set `maxSlotsPerPod` to
# the greatest common divisor of all the sizes (4, in that case).

## For CPU-only clusters, use `slotType: cpu`, and make sure to set `slotResourceRequest` below.
# slotType: cpu
# slotResourceRequests:

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be
# packaged into versioned archives to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart
# developer. They're included as a dependency of application charts to
# inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore
# cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented
# each time you make changes to the chart and its templates, including
# the app version.  Versions are expected to follow Semantic
# Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 2.4.0-alpha.2

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This
# version number should be incremented each time you make changes to
# the application. Versions are not expected to follow Semantic
# Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is
# using.

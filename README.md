# Console

## Installation

The following command will install dependencies in `./`, `./frontend`, and `./backend`.

```bash
make install
```

If you are on an M1 Mac, first run these commands or installation will fail:

<!-- https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues/1733 -->

```bash
brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg
```

[You may also need to install rosetta to run the jq binary that `node-jq` installs.](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/issues/2386#issuecomment-1116727751)

## Local Deploy

You can run Console locally against either of the following:

1. A mock backend with useful fixtures.
1. A real Pachyderm cluster.

When Console runs it will be live at `localhost:4000`.

### Against the mock backend

Note: Ensure you disable port-forwarding from a real pachyderm cluster.

The following command will start the UI server, API server, and mock gRPC server all-in-one.

```bash
make launch-mock
```

To switch between mock accounts use our devtools in the JS console of the browser.

```bash
> devtools.setAccount('2'); // will switch your current account
```

### Against a real Pachyderm cluster

1. [Deploy Pachyderm locally](./README_Pachyderm.md) in either Enterprise or Community Edition.
1. Ensure Pachyderm is port-forwarded with `pachctl port-forward`
1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   make launch-dev
   ```

## Logs

If you want pretty server logs [use the bunyan cli tool](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#cli-usage).

While in the root folder run:

```bash
make launch-dev | make bunyan
```

You can filter only records above a certain level by adding `-l warn` to the bunyan make reference:

Inside of root the root Makefile, find the entry for bunyan. Change it to `npm exec --prefix backend bunyan -- -l warn`.

## Testing

### What tests do we have?

Console frontend tests consist of:

1. Jest unit tests against:

   1. The mock backend.
   1. A component library.

1. Cypress E2E tests against:
   1. A real Pachyderm cluster in EE (auth).
   1. A real Pachyderm cluster in CE (unauth).
   1. The mock backend (mock).

Console backend tests consist of:

1. Backend unit tests
1. Backend integration tests

### Running unit / integration tests

The following command runs unit and integration tests in `./frontend` and `./backend`.

```bash
make test
```

You may want to be more precise in either frontend or backend tests. To run jest against a single test, `cd` into the appropriate directory and provide a pattern for the test runner.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:frontend TestName.test.ts
npm run test:components Button
```

If you want to only run one of the tests outlined above refer to the `package.json` found in the subdirectory `frontend` or `backend`.

### E2E tests

We use Cypress for E2E tests.

There are three distinct sets of tests. They run against:

1. Community Edition.
1. Enterprise Edition.
1. The mock backend.

Before running one of the above sets of tests you must configure your local pachyderm and console setup to match what the test is expecting to test against.

**Otherwise, to run either of the authenticated (Enterprise)or unauthenticated (Community Edition) test suites:**

1. [Run and port-forward a local Pachyderm cluster](./README_Pachyderm.md) in either Enterprise or Community Edition.
1. Run Console locally with `make launch-dev`.
1. Use one of the following commands to start Cypress:

**To run the authenticated (Enterprise) test suite:**

```bash
make e2e-auth
```

**To run the unauthenticated (Community Edition) test suite:**

1. Note: Ensure you add `PACHYDERM_ENTERPRISE_KEY` env variable with a valid [Enterprise key](https://enterprise-token-gen.pachyderm.io/dev) to your `.env.development.local`. Otherwise one test will fail.

2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   make e2e
   ```

## Running the production server

```bash
make launch-prod
```

This will start the production server at `localhost:3000`. Additionally, if you'd like to test the production UI/API against the mock gRPC & Auth server, you can run `npm run start:mock` from /backend and add a `.env.production.local` file that replicates the variables found in `.env.test`.

## Environment variables

All variables are stored in `.env.${environmentName}`. You can find a list of the default variables configured in the Console container in the `.env.production` file.

### React build-time variables

Build-time variables are embedded into the JavaScript files during the build process. Any variable starting with the `REACT_APP` prefix (without `_RUNTIME`) are build-time variables.

Our build tool, Vite, first looks at the `REACT_APP` variables present in the `.env` or environment, then scans the code for any occurrences of `process.env.WHATEVER` during the build process. It then statically replaces these instances with the value of the environment variable.

```ts
// .env.production
REACT_APP_PORT = 3000;

// React code
const port = process.env.REACT_APP_PORT;

// Built React code
const port = 3000;
```

⚠️ Be aware, since `process` is not available in the browser, errors may occur if a `REACT_APP` env var exists in your code but is not defined in all `.env.ENVIRONMENT` files. The call to `process.env.WHATEVER` will not be replaced, leading to an error when the browser attempts to run it.

ℹ️ In the Node.js runtime (on the server, and during test execution), these variables can be accessed like other environment variables on `process.env`, without referring to pachDashConfig.

### React runtime variables

Variables prefixed with the `REACT_APP_RUNTIME` are runtime variables. In a similiar manner to build-time variables, Vite statically replaces these with references to `window.pachDashConfig.WHATEVER` during the build process. The `pachDashConfig` object is then injected into the served index.html by our Express server at runtime.

The helper module at [runtimeVariables.ts](./frontend/src/lib/runtimeVariables.ts) handles these variables in the frontend, retrieving these variables correctly depending on the current environment (dev or prod).

```ts
// .env.production
REACT_APP_RUNTIME_PORT = 3000;

// React code
const port = process.env.REACT_APP_RUNTIME_PORT;

// Built React code
const port = window.pachDashConfig.REACT_APP_RUNTIME_PORT;
```

ℹ️ These are needed so that end-users can inject env vars from the Helm chart when they deploy Pachyderm. Adding a runtime variable to the helm chart is a manual process.

### Shared variables

Variables prefixed with `REACT_APP` or `_RUNTIME` are both available in the backend server. If you need to share an environment variable between the client and the server code, use the `REACT_APP` or `REACT_APP_RUNTIME` prefixes.

```ts
// can be used both on frontend and backend
const apiEndpoint = process.env.REACT_APP_REPORTING_API_ENDPOINT;
```

### Server-only variables

Finally, variables without `REACT_APP` or `REACT_APP_RUNTIME` prefixes are server-only variables and are only accessible in the server-side code.

```ts
// .env.production
PORT = 3000;

// server code
const port = process.env.PORT;
```

## Debugging Tests

To debug tests, add `--node-options=--inspect-brk` to npx. Like the following command:

```shell
npx --node-options=--inspect-brk jest
```

This command will execute Jest and pause its execution until you attach a debugger. You can then use the debugger to inspect and debug your test code.

You can attach the VSCode debugger by opening the command pallete and using `Debug: Attach to Node Process`.

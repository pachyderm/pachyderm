## Install Dependencies
```
make install
```

## Running tests
```
make test
```

## Graphql GQL/TS generation
```
make graphql
```


## Development

### Against the mock gRPC
To run the development environment against the mock gRPC server, run:

`make launch-mock`

This will start the UI server, API server, mock gRPC server, and a mock IDP. You can access the UI in the browser at `localhost:4000`.

#### Setting account
To switch between mock accounts, you can use our devtools in the JS console of the browser.

```
> devtools.setAccount('2'); // will set your account to Barret Wallace
```

### Using 2.0 Pachyderm Cluster ðŸš§
This feature is still under development, and will likely change.

#### Deploy locally without the Console pod
1. [Install helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
1. Grab the latest pachyderm helm chart: `helm repo add pachyderm https://pachyderm.github.io/helmchart`
1. If you haven't already, start up minikube
1. Install pachyderm locally: `helm install pachyderm --set deployTarget=LOCAL --version 2.0.0-rc.1 pachyderm/pachyderm`
1. Delete your existing pre-2.0 pachctl config file: `rm ~/.pachyderm/config.json`

#### Configuring Auth
1. [Create a Github OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app). For local clusters, set your callback url to `http://localhost:30658/callback`. Make sure to save the secret key, you'll need it for the next step.
1. Generate an enterprise key for the next step: https://enterprise-token-gen.pachyderm.io/dev. For Mac OS users, `echo '<your-enterprise-token-here>' | pachctl license activate`.
1. Run `make setup-auth`. This will walk you through the setup for your local cluster.
1. Run `pachctl port-forward`
1. (Optional) Use `pachctl auth login` to login via Github. If you opt not to do this, you will continue as the root user when creating resources.

#### Accessing Console
1. Run `make launch-dev`.
1. Make sure to delete any existing `auth-token` from the mock-server in `localStorage`.
1. Navigate to `localhost:4000` in the browser.

## Running the production server

`make launch-prod`

This will start the production server at `localhost:3000`. Additionally, if you'd like to test the production UI/API against the mock gRPC & Auth server, you can run `npm run start:mock` from /backend and add a `.env.production.local` file that replicates the variables found in `.env.test`.

## Working with environment variables
All variables are stored in `.env.${environmentName}`

### Client build-time variables
Any variables added with the `REACT_APP` prefix (no `_RUNTIME`) will be appended to
the `process.env` object in the client Javascript bundle.

```
// client-side code
const port = process.env.REACT_APP_PORT;
```

### Client runtime variables
Any variables with the `REACT_APP_RUNTIME` prefix will be added to a window object
called `pachDashConfig` with can be accessed in the client code:

```
// client-side code
const port = process.env.pachDashConfig.REACT_APP_RUNTIME_PORT;
```

These variables can also be accessed in the node runtime (on the server, and during test execution), but not via the `pachDashConfig` object. The reason for this, is that
the node runtime does not support maps as environment variables.

```
// node runtime
const port = process.env.REACT_APP_RUNTIME_PORT;
```

### Server-only variables
Any variables not prefixed with `REACT_APP` or `REACT_APP_RUNTIME` will only be accessible from the server __only__.

```
// server code
const port = process.env.PORT;
```

## Deploying Dash

### Environment variables
You can find a list of the default variables configured in the dash container in the `.env.production` file. The variables you _may_ need to override in your deployment are:

- PACHD_ADDRESS
- OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
- OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
- OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI
- ISSUER_URI

# Pachyderm â€“ Automate data transformations with data versioning and lineage


Pachyderm is cost-effective at scale, enabling data engineering teams to automate complex pipelines with sophisticated data transformations across any type of data. Our unique approach provides parallelized processing of multi-stage, language-agnostic pipelines with data versioning and data lineage tracking. Pachyderm delivers the ultimate CI/CD engine for data. 

## Features

- Data-driven pipelines automatically trigger based on detecting data changes.
- Immutable data lineage with data versioning of any data type. 
- Autoscaling and parallel processing built on Kubernetes for resource orchestration.
- Uses standard object stores for data storage with automatic deduplication.  
- Runs across all major cloud providers and on-premises installations.


## Getting Started
To start deploying your end-to-end version-controlled data pipelines, run Pachyderm [locally](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/set-up/local-deploy/) or you can also [deploy on AWS/GCE/Azure](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/set-up/cloud-deploy) in about 5 minutes.

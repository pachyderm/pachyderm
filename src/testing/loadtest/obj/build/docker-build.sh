# Run compilation inside golang container, with pachyderm mounted
# Explanation of mounts
# ---------------------
# - _out is where the binaries built in this docker image are written out for
#   us to use:
#     /out <- ./_out
#
# - $HOME/.cache/go-build holds cached docker builds; mounting it makes builds
#   faster:
#     /root/.cache/go-build <- $HOME/.cache/go-build
#
# - Mounting the whole pachyderm repo (including the pachyderm client and this
#   benchmark) makes this benchmark available to be built. Mounting all of it in
#   together (rather than e.g. mounting just this dir and having the pachyderm
#   repo in ./vendor) means that parallel changes can be made to the benchmark,
#   server, and client simultaneously:
#     /go/src/.../pachyderm <- $GOPATH/src/.../pachyerm/
#

Currently users are identified with their email address rather than their OIDC subject identifier to make switching between OIDC ID providers easier for users, and to make user identities more easily comprehensible in Pachyderm. The OIDC spec doesn't require that users' emails be present or unique, but we think this will be preferable in practice."

Storing the error state here allows any sibling calls to Authenticate() (i.e. using the same OIDC state token) to notify their caller that an error has occurred. We avoid passing the caller any details of the error (which are logged by Pachyderm) to avoid giving information to a user who has network access to Pachyderm but not an account in the OIDC provider."

Sessions are short-lived and stored in the 'oidc-authns' collection, keyed by the OIDC 'state' token (30-character CSPRNG-generated string). 'GetOIDCLogin' generates and inserts entries, then /authorization-code/callback retrieves an access token from the ID provider and uses it to retrive the caller's email and store it in 'email', and finally Authorize() returns a Pachyderm token identified with that email address as a subject in Pachyderm."

// Service manages the distributed processing of tasks.

// Task:
// A task is a unit of work that can be processed by a worker.
// The input / output of a task should be fully specifiable by an Any proto.
// The processing of a task should produce a single output Any or an error.
// A task when run may have side effects, but is idempotent.
// A task can be run 0 or more times.
// A task can be run 0 times when a task with the same description (hash of the input Any) has been
// processed already (only applicable when using a caching layer).
// A task can be run multiple times if issues outside of the task processing occur.
// A task must allow for two or more workers to process it concurrently and perform side effects correctly.
// Tasks are managed by Doers and provided to client workers for processing through Sources.
// NOTE: In general, tasks should be designed to take at least seconds and ideally minutes because
// that is usually a good balance of being long enough to minimize the overhead of laying out the
// work and not being too long to restart from scratch.

// Namespace:
// A task managed by a Service has a namespace.
// The namespace is used for scoping the Doers and Sources of tasks such that clients can create workers
// that only process tasks created by clients in the same namespace.

// A Service can create Doers and Sources and provide information about current tasks.
//
// Scheduling:
// A task managed by a Service has a group.
// The group is used for scheduling purposes.
// Scheduling is based on maximizing fairness for the groups, and the schedulable unit is a task.

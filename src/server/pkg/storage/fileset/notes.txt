- I am drawing a distinction between parts of a fileset and the merge log because I think it makes sense to require
the full merging of data within a commit. The merge log will apply across commit boundaries. This also makes the finishing
step a bit easier because we simply merge everything in memory and in the scratch space, then maybe merge with the parent commits
based on some heuristics.
- This should be used primarily for a fileset that requires Put/Overwrite/Delete operations (input repos, uploading datum/chunk data).
For merging multiple serialized filesets, a Scratch and/or Merge operation should be used.
- Example structure in object storage:
/pfs/repo/commit/shard-0/fileset
/pfs/repo/commit/shard-0/index
/pfs/repo/commit/shard-0/mergelog
/pfs/repo/commit/shard-1/fileset
/pfs/repo/commit/shard-1/index
/pfs/repo/commit/shard-1/mergelog
/pfs/chunks/8cfd
/pfs/chunks/ef7d
/pfs/chunks/823a
/pfs/chunks/b54d
- Handling of shards will happen outside of the storage layer (does not make sense for storage layer to understand
workers and how to filter chunk data from them)
- Merging for downstream datums can take advantage of the fact that only the datums modified in the most recent input commit 
should be getting processed. Some details about file deletions need to be taken into account.  
- Keep checkpoint around (full merge) separate from output for the particular job. Can delete checkpoint to save space at the
cost of having to do more merges for older commits.
- The larger the metadata:data ratio gets, the more value we will get out of chunk compression in terms of metadata storage.
  - Metadata should in general have highly compressable data (same user id, permissions, chunk references, padding).
  - If the metadata:data ratio is small, then the value of compression goes down, but the metadata is smaller therefore it is not as valuable anyways.
  - This is just a general note not to be too concerned with storing repeating metadata for each file.
- At each commit, store the output of the commit. Merge log will point to prior commits. If merging a set of prior commits (small commits chosen by heuristic),
  we will write a new merged fileset. If this new fileset is used in a later merge, then we can delete it if no checkpointing is involved.
- Think about reference counters for chunks when designing this.

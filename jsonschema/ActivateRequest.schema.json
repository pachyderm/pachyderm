Basically, anywhere that Pachyderm refers to a subject (i.e. TokenInfo) or principal (ACL, the 'admins' collection), that username will have some structured prefix. Note that externally-facing principals ({Get,Set}{Scope,ACL}, ModifyAdmins, ListAdmins) will have their own conventions The current user formats are: 1) Users synced from an identity provider:      \"user:username\" 2) Pachyderm robot users:      \"robot:robot_user_1\" 3) Pachyderm pipelines:      \"pipeline:terasort\"  // Activation API  ActivateRequest enables authentication on the cluster. It issues an auth token with no expiration for the irrevocable admin user `pach:root`."

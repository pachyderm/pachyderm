> - Branch Master: Examples using Pachyderm 2.0 and later versions - https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples
> - Branch 1.13.x: Examples using Pachyderm 1.13 and older versions - https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/1.13.x/examples

# Group Pipelines 
>![pach_logo](./img/pach_logo.svg) The group functionality is available in version **1.12 and higher**.


## Intro
You configure a group in the [pipeline specification](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/reference/pipeline_spec/) file by adding a `group` input around the one or many pfs repositories you want to aggregate together. At each input repo level included in your group, you then need to specify a `group_by` that will define the capture group from your glob pattern that you want to consider to group your files. 


- Our first examples will walk you through a simple use of group applied to the files of a single repository. 
- Our second example will showcase a more complex group setting where information is grouped accross 3 repositories. 

>![pach_logo](./img/pach_logo.svg) Remember, in Pachyderm, the group operates at the file-path level, **not** the content of the files themselves. Therefore, the structure of your directories and file naming conventions are key elements when implementing your use cases in Pachyderm.


## Getting ready
***Key concepts***
- [Group](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/group/) pipelines - execute your code on files that match a specific naming pattern in your group repo(s).
- [glob patterns](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/glob-pattern/) - for "RegEx-like" string matching on file paths and names.

You might also want to brush up your [datum](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/concepts/pipeline-concepts/datum/relationship-between-datums/) knowledge. 

***Prerequisite***
- A workspace on [Pachyderm Hub](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/pachhub/pachhub_getting_started/) (recommended) or Pachyderm running [locally](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/getting_started/local_installation/).
- [pachctl command-line ](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/getting_started/local_installation/#install-pachctl) installed, and your context created (i.e., you are logged in)

***Getting started***
- Clone this repo.
- Make sure Pachyderm is running. You should be able to connect to your Pachyderm cluster via the `pachctl` CLI. 
Run a quick:
```shell
$ pachctl version

COMPONENT           VERSION
pachctl             2.0.0
pachd               2.0.0
```
Ideally, have your pachctl and pachd versions match. At a minimum, you should always use the same major & minor versions of your pachctl and pachd. 

## Example 1 - Simple group-by pipelines 
***Data structure and naming convention***

Our first example comes from a simple healthcare use case:

* A patient gets test results, each of which can come from a different lab. Each of our files contains the test results from a particular lab for a given patient.

Let's have a look at the data structure and naming convention of our first example:  
* Repo: `labresults` - Our file names follow the following "-" separated pattern: 

1. **T** + {Time stamp}
2. Type of test (Here **LIPID** for all our files)
3. **PATID** + {Patient identifier}
4. **CLIA** + {Lab/Hospital identifier}

```shell
    └── T1606707557-LIPID-PATID1-CLIA24D9871327.txt
    └── T1606331395-LIPID-PATID2-CLIA24D9871327.txt
    └── T1606707613-LIPID-PATID1-CLIA24D9871328.txt
    └──  ...
```
For information, here is what the content of those txt files looks like. 

![labresultsample.png](./img/labresultsample.png)

***Goal***
We  want to aggregate our labresults by patient or by hospital. We will create two separate pipelines out of the same repository, one for each case.

1. **Pipeline input repository**: `labresults` 
    - Group by patient: the group will be done by PATID 
    - Group by hospital: the group will be done by CLIA

1. **Pipeline**: Executes a set of command lines creating a new directory named after each capture group and copying the files that match the given group. (See our 2 pipelines:[`lab_group_by_hospital.json`](./lab_group_by_hospital.json) and [`lab_group_by_patient.json`](./lab_group_by_patient.json)).

1. **Pipeline output repository**: `group_by_hospital`or `group_by_patient` depending on which use case you run - Each output repo will contain a list or sub-directories named after each capture group and populated with a copy of their matching files.
In the diagram below, we have mapped out the data of our example and the expected results in each case.
![group_example1](./img/group_example1.png)

***Example walkthrough***

1. Prepare your data:
 
    Let's first create our mock dataset and create/populate our repository.
    The setup target `setup-lab` of the `Makefile` in `pachyderm/examples/group` will create a directory (labresults) with our example data.
    In the `examples/group` directory, run:
    ```shell
    $ make setup-lab
    ```
1. Create/populate Pachyderm's repository and create your pipelines:

    In the `examples/joins` directory, run:
    ```shell
    $ make deploy-lab
    ```
    or run:
    ```shell
    $ pachctl create repo labresults
    $ pachctl put file -r labresults@master:/ -f labresults
    $ pachctl create pipeline -f lab_group_by_hospital.json 
    $ pachctl create pipeline -f lab_group_by_patient.json
    ```
    Have a quick look at your repositories: 
    ```shell
    $ pachctl list file labresults@master
    ```
    You should see the following files:

    ![labresults repo](./img/list_file_labresults_master.png)

    The commit in your entry repository has triggered the execution of your pipeline (i.e., a job). Have a quick check at your pipeline's status:
    ```shell
    $ pachctl list pipeline
    ```
    Once it has run successfully, you should see something like this:

    ![pipelines](./img/lab_list_pipeline.png)

1. Let's have a look at our final product: 

    Check the output repository of your pipeline.
    ```shell
    $ pachctl list file group_by_patient@master
    $ pachctl list file group_by_hospital@master
    ```
    You should see your expected sub repositories. 

    Check one testresult for patient 1:
    ```shell
    $ pachctl get file group_by_patient@master:/1/T1606707613-LIPID-PATID1-CLIA24D9871328.txt
    ```

## Example 2 - Group pipeline on several repositories 
***Data structure and naming convention***

The second example is derived from a simplified retail use case: 
- Purchases and returns are made in given stores. 
- Those stores have a given location (here, a zip code). 
- There are 0 to many stores in a given zip code.

This dataset is shared with the "Join pipelines"' examples. Read about the [structure of the data and naming conventions](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/blob/master/examples/joins/README.md#2-data-structure-and-naming-convention).


***Goal***
For each store, we are going to calculate the net amount of all transactions (net_amount = order_total - return_total) and save it to a text file named after the store identifier.

1. **Pipeline input repositories**: `stores` , `returns`, `purchases` 
    - Group by STOREID on all 3 repositories. 
    
    Each match (i.e., all transactions - purchases and returns - having occured at a given store along with the store information itself) will generate one datum.
2. **Pipeline**: Executes a python code reading the `purchases` and `returns` for each matching STOREID and writing the corresponding net_amount to a text file named after the STOREID. (See our pipeline: [`retail_group.json`](./retail_group.json))
3. **Pipeline output repository**: `group_store_revenue` - list of text files named after the STOREID. 

In the diagram below, we have mapped out our data. 

![group_example2](./img/group_example2.png)

The following table lists the expected result (the "net amount") for each store. 

![group_example2_digest](./img/group_example2_digest.png)

***Example walkthrough***

1. Let's create your new data:

    In the `examples/group` directory, run:
    ```shell
    $ make setup-retail
    ```
    You just created 3 directories: stores, purchases, returns. Check them out.
    ```shell
    $ ls ./purchases
    ```

1. Create/populate Pachyderm’s repository and create your pipelines:

    In the `examples/group` directory, run:
    ```shell
    $ make deploy-retail
    ```
    or run:
    ```shell
    $ pachctl create repo stores
    $ pachctl create repo purchases
    $ pachctl create repo returns
    $ pachctl put file -r stores@master:/ -f stores
    $ pachctl put file -r purchases@master:/ -f purchases
    $ pachctl put file -r returns@master:/ -f returns
    $ pachctl create pipeline -f retail_group.json
    ```
    check your repositories:
    ```shell
    $ pachctl list file stores@master
    $ pachctl list file purchases@master
    $ pachctl list file returns@master	
    ```
    Here is the list of the files in the purchases repo:

    ![list_file_purchase_master](./img/list_file_purchase_master.png)

    and your pipeline:
    ```shell
    $ pachctl list pipeline
    ```
    ![retail_list_pipeline](./img/retail_list_pipeline.png)

1. Have a look at your final product:

    Once it has fully and successfully run, have a look at your output repository to confirm that it looks like what we expect.
    ```shell
    $ pachctl list file group_store_revenue@master
    ```
    Now for a visual confirmation of the content of each specific file:
    ```shell
    $ pachctl get file group_store_revenue@master:/5.txt
    ```
    It should look like this:

    ![get_file_group_store_revenue_master](./img/get_file_group_store_revenue_master.png)

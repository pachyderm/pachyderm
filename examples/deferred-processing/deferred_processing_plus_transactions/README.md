# Deferred Processing Plus Transactions

This example, 
which uses a simple DAG based on our [OpenCV example](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/opencv), 
illustrates two Pachyderm usage patterns for fine-grain control over when pipelines trigger jobs.

[Deferred processing](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/how-tos/deferred-processing/) 
is a Pachyderm technique for controlling when data gets processed.
Deferred processing uses branches to prevent pipelines from triggering on every input commit.

[Transactions](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/how-tos/use-transactions-to-run-multiple-commands/) are a Pachyderm feature 
that allows you to batch match multiple operations at once,
such as committing data to two different repos, 
but only trigger a single job, 
so data from both repos gets processed together.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have Pachyderm v1.9.8 or later installed on your computer or cloud platform. 
See [Deploy Pachyderm](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/deploy-manage/deploy/).

## Pipelines

The following diagram demonstrates the DAG that is used in this example.

![Example DAG](example_dag.png)

The DAG shown is a simple elaboration on the OpenCV example,
with pipeline and repo names chosen to avoid collisions with that example 
if installed in the same cluster.

The functionality is slightly different.
The `edges_dp` pipeline performs edge detection on images committed to `images_dp_1`.
`montage_dp` pipeline creates a montage out of images committed to `images_dp_2` and images in the master branch of `edges_dp`. 
This configuration enables you to verify the files being processed
by visually inspecting the montage.

The most significant change from the OpenCV example is the pipeline spec for `edges_dp`,
which has the `output_branch` attribute set to `dev`.
It also has added a `name` field to the `input` repo,
to avoid having to change the code in the example.

```json hl_lines="9,12"
{
    "pipeline": {
        "name": "edges_dp"
    },
    "input": {
        "pfs": {
            "glob": "/*",
            "repo": "images_dp_1",
            "name": "images"
        }
    },
    "output_branch": "dev",
    "transform": {
        "cmd": [ "python3", "/edges.py" ],
        "image": "pachyderm/opencv"
    }
}
```

Therefore, 
this pipeline puts the output in the `dev` branch
instead of putting it in the `master` branch.

Since `montage_dp` is subscribed to the master branch of `edges_dp`, jobs will not trigger when the edges pipeline outputs files to the `dev` branch. Instead, to trigger a montage job, 
we can simply create a `master` branch attached to any commit in `edges_dp` to trigger the pipeline.

## Example run-through

This section provides steps that you can run to test this example.

### Deferred Processing

You should have a Pachyderm cluster set up 
and access to it configured from your local computer
before you run this example.

1. Run the script `setup.sh` included in this repo.
   The script executes the following commands:
   
   ```shell
   pachctl create repo images_dp_1
   pachctl create repo images_dp_2
   pachctl create pipeline -f ./edges_dp.json 
   pachctl create pipeline -f ./montage_dp.json 
   pachctl put file images_dp_1@master -i ./images.txt
   pachctl put file images_dp_1@master -i ./images2.txt
   pachctl put file images_dp_2@master -i ./images3.txt
   ```
   
2. Once the demo is loaded, 
   check the commits in `edges_dp`.
   You should see an output similar to this.
   Note that there are two commits in `edges_dp`
   both in the `dev` branch that is the output for the pipeline:
   
   ```shell
   $  pachctl list commit edges_dp
   REPO     BRANCH COMMIT                           FINISHED       
   edges_dp dev    364f49663dd848098b60c1ac97a332af 36 seconds ago 
   edges_dp dev    a07c857b91a14add9f8309a81d86dbe8 44 seconds ago 
   ```
   
   Remember that the `edges_dp` pipeline outputs to the `dev` branch.
   Since the `montage_dp` pipeline subscribes to the `master` branch,
   it will not be triggered when `edges_dp` jobs complete,
   since that output goes into the `dev` branch.

3. List the branches in `edges_dp`.
   
   ```shell
   $ pachctl list branch edges_dp
   BRANCH HEAD                             
   master -                                
   dev    364f49663dd848098b60c1ac97a332af 
   ```
   
   Note that the `dev` branch has the most recent commit.
   Take note of the commit id and match it to the id above.
   The `master` branch does not have any commits.

4. View the list of jobs:
   
   ```shell
   $ pachctl list job
   ID                               PIPELINE   STARTED            DURATION  RESTART PROGRESS  DL       UL       STATE   
   2288709b4d8044409c2232d673ec8f23 montage_dp 55 seconds ago     1 second  0       0 + 0 / 0 0B       0B       success 
   6d9d4cf0f6524b0ca126fa97141303ea edges_dp   About a minute ago 4 seconds 0       2 + 1 / 3 181.1KiB 111.4KiB success 
   fcaf537975554935b0f15d184d7a0984 edges_dp   About a minute ago 3 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 57.27KiB 22.22KiB success 

   ```
   
   You should see that there are three jobs:
   - one 0-datum job for `montage_dp` and 
   - two jobs for `edges_dp` with the appropriate number of datums in each.
   
   This is what you should expect.
   There is no data in the master branch of `edges_dp`, 
   so an empty job was created in `montage_dp`
   when data was commited to `images_dp_2`
   because of its `cross` input.
   
5. Commit a file to `images_dp_1`. 

   ```shell
   $ pachctl put file images_dp_1@master:1VqcWw9.jpg -f http://imgur.com/1VqcWw9.jpg
   ```

6. View the list of jobs, again. 

   ```shell
   $ pachctl list job
   ID                               PIPELINE   STARTED            DURATION  RESTART PROGRESS  DL       UL       STATE   
   c7e69e46e9954611ad8efc8aeac47f2a edges_dp   12 seconds ago     3 seconds 0       1 + 3 / 4 175.1KiB 92.18KiB success 
   2288709b4d8044409c2232d673ec8f23 montage_dp About a minute ago 1 second  0       0 + 0 / 0 0B       0B       success 
   6d9d4cf0f6524b0ca126fa97141303ea edges_dp   About a minute ago 4 seconds 0       2 + 1 / 3 181.1KiB 111.4KiB success 
   fcaf537975554935b0f15d184d7a0984 edges_dp   About a minute ago 3 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 57.27KiB 22.22KiB success 
   ```

   You see that one job was triggered in `edges_dp`
   with the one datum we committed, above, processed
   and the three existing datums skipped.
   You may also confirm that no job was triggered for `montage_dp`. 
   
7. To trigger `montage_dp` on the set of data in our `dev` branch,
   you create a `master` branch with `dev` as its head.
   
   ```shell
   $ pachctl create branch edges_dp@master --head dev
   ```
   
8. Listing jobs will show that a job got triggered on `montage_dp`:

    ```shell
    $ pachctl list job
    ID                               PIPELINE   STARTED        DURATION  RESTART PROGRESS  DL       UL       STATE   
    e5a116fd9c2e4678a0f49fcb2f8c8331 montage_dp 10 seconds ago 4 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 919.6KiB 1.055MiB success 
    c7e69e46e9954611ad8efc8aeac47f2a edges_dp   42 seconds ago 3 seconds 0       1 + 3 / 4 175.1KiB 92.18KiB success 
    2288709b4d8044409c2232d673ec8f23 montage_dp 2 minutes ago  1 second  0       0 + 0 / 0 0B       0B       success 
    6d9d4cf0f6524b0ca126fa97141303ea edges_dp   2 minutes ago  4 seconds 0       2 + 1 / 3 181.1KiB 111.4KiB success 
    fcaf537975554935b0f15d184d7a0984 edges_dp   2 minutes ago  3 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 57.27KiB 22.22KiB success 
    ```

9. Commit more data to `images_dp_1`.
   It will only trigger a job in `edges_dp`:

    ```shell
    $ pachctl put file images_dp_1@master:2GI70mb.jpg -f http://imgur.com/2GI70mb.jpg
    $ pachctl list job
    ID                               PIPELINE   STARTED        DURATION  RESTART PROGRESS  DL       UL       STATE   
    65eacaae2e63461bbfc1ed609e8b6f5e edges_dp   8 seconds ago  3 seconds 0       1 + 4 / 5 204KiB   18.89KiB success 
    e5a116fd9c2e4678a0f49fcb2f8c8331 montage_dp 13 minutes ago 4 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 919.6KiB 1.055MiB success 
    c7e69e46e9954611ad8efc8aeac47f2a edges_dp   13 minutes ago 3 seconds 0       1 + 3 / 4 175.1KiB 92.18KiB success 
    2288709b4d8044409c2232d673ec8f23 montage_dp 15 minutes ago 1 second  0       0 + 0 / 0 0B       0B       success 
    6d9d4cf0f6524b0ca126fa97141303ea edges_dp   15 minutes ago 4 seconds 0       2 + 1 / 3 181.1KiB 111.4KiB success 
    fcaf537975554935b0f15d184d7a0984 edges_dp   15 minutes ago 3 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 57.27KiB 22.22KiB success
    ```

10. Move the `master` branch in `edges_dp` to point dev, again.
    It will trigger a job against the data currently in dev.

    ```shell
    $ pachctl create branch edges_dp@master --head dev
    $ pachctl list job
    ID                               PIPELINE   STARTED        DURATION  RESTART PROGRESS  DL       UL       STATE   
    65eddcb60ae1475aa6d59b2baa69c78e montage_dp 8 seconds ago  5 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 938.5KiB 1.066MiB success 
    65eacaae2e63461bbfc1ed609e8b6f5e edges_dp   3 minutes ago  3 seconds 0       1 + 4 / 5 204KiB   18.89KiB success 
    e5a116fd9c2e4678a0f49fcb2f8c8331 montage_dp 16 minutes ago 4 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 919.6KiB 1.055MiB success 
    c7e69e46e9954611ad8efc8aeac47f2a edges_dp   16 minutes ago 3 seconds 0       1 + 3 / 4 175.1KiB 92.18KiB success 
    2288709b4d8044409c2232d673ec8f23 montage_dp 18 minutes ago 1 second  0       0 + 0 / 0 0B       0B       success 
    6d9d4cf0f6524b0ca126fa97141303ea edges_dp   18 minutes ago 4 seconds 0       2 + 1 / 3 181.1KiB 111.4KiB success 
    fcaf537975554935b0f15d184d7a0984 edges_dp   18 minutes ago 3 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 57.27KiB 22.22KiB success 
    ```


### Transactions

After you test deferred processing, 
you can explore how transactions work in combination with deferred processing.

1. If you want to run a particular set of data in `images_dp_2` 
    against a particular branch of `edges_dp`,
    you need to perform two operations
    - commit data to `images_dp_2` and
    - point `edges_dp@master` to the specific commit of interest.
    
    If you do not use a transaction, this will result in two jobs being triggered, one for the new commit and a second when we move `edges_dp@master` branch.
    - `images_dp_2@master` running against whatever is currently in `edges_dp@master`
    - `images_dp_2@master` running against whatever you set `edges_dp@master` to
    
    Remember that in step 10 above, 
    we performed the `create branch` operation against `edges_dp`.
    Now we perform the commit to `images_dp_2`.
    and see that another job got triggered.
    
    ```shell
    $ pachctl put file images_dp_2@master:3Kr6Mr6.jpg  -f http://imgur.com/3Kr6Mr6.jpg
    $ pachctl list job
    $ pachctl list job
    ID                               PIPELINE   STARTED        DURATION  RESTART PROGRESS  DL       UL       STATE   
    9c97578031544cab9cc5fb64e9d77153 montage_dp 9 seconds ago  5 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 1015KiB  1.292MiB success 
    65eddcb60ae1475aa6d59b2baa69c78e montage_dp 28 seconds ago 5 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 938.5KiB 1.066MiB success 
    65eacaae2e63461bbfc1ed609e8b6f5e edges_dp   3 minutes ago  3 seconds 0       1 + 4 / 5 204KiB   18.89KiB success 
    e5a116fd9c2e4678a0f49fcb2f8c8331 montage_dp 16 minutes ago 4 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 919.6KiB 1.055MiB success 
    c7e69e46e9954611ad8efc8aeac47f2a edges_dp   16 minutes ago 3 seconds 0       1 + 3 / 4 175.1KiB 92.18KiB success 
    2288709b4d8044409c2232d673ec8f23 montage_dp 18 minutes ago 1 second  0       0 + 0 / 0 0B       0B       success 
    6d9d4cf0f6524b0ca126fa97141303ea edges_dp   18 minutes ago 4 seconds 0       2 + 1 / 3 181.1KiB 111.4KiB success 
    fcaf537975554935b0f15d184d7a0984 edges_dp   18 minutes ago 3 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 57.27KiB 22.22KiB success 
    ```
    
2. If you want to just have one job 
    where `images_dp_2@master` runs against whatever you set `edges_dp@master` to,
    you can use Pachyderm transactions.
    First step is to start a transaction.
    
    ```shell
    $ pachctl start transaction
    Started new transaction: 11fbbcbd-6cda-42fa-b1fe-cd63b292582e
    ```
    
3. Once the transaction is started,
    you start all commits and branch creations 
    within the scope of the transaction. 
    
    ```shell
    $ pachctl start commit  images_dp_2@master
    Added to transaction: 11fbbcbd-6cda-42fa-b1fe-cd63b292582e
    de55d4856e814c41a65836321fe672fa
    $ pachctl create branch edges_dp@master --head dev
    Added to transaction: 11fbbcbd-6cda-42fa-b1fe-cd63b292582e
    ```


4.  Before you put any files in a repo, 
    you need to finish the transaction.
    When you run `pachctl finish transaction`, Pachyderm groups all the commits and branches together,
    triggering when the last commit in the transaction is finished.
    
    ```shell
    $ pachctl finish transaction
    Completed transaction with 2 requests: 11fbbcbd-6cda-42fa-b1fe-cd63b292582e
    ```
    
5.  Commit a file, 
    and job list will show no new jobs.
    
    ```shell
    $ pachctl put file images_dp_2@master:9iIlokw.jpg -f http://imgur.com/9iIlokw.jpg
    $ pachctl list job
    ID                               PIPELINE   STARTED        DURATION  RESTART PROGRESS  DL       UL       STATE   
    9c97578031544cab9cc5fb64e9d77153 montage_dp 18 minutes ago 5 seconds 0       1 + 0 / 1 1015KiB  1.292MiB success

    c7e69e46e9954611ad8efc8aeac47f2a edges_dp   36 minutes ago 3 seconds 0       1 + 3 / 4 175.1KiB 92.18KiB success

    6d9d4cf0f6524b0ca126fa97141303ea edges_dp   38 minutes ago 4 seconds 0       2 + 1 / 3 181.1KiB 111.4KiB success

    ```

6.  Finish the commit that you started during the transaction.
    That will start the job.

    ```
    $ pachctl finish commit images_dp_2@master
    $ pachctl list job
    ID                               PIPELINE   STARTED        DURATION  RESTART PROGRESS  DL       UL       STATE

    ```

## Summary

Deferred processing with transactions in Pachyderm 
will give you fine-grained control of jobs and datums
while preserving Pachyderm's advantages of data lineage and incremental processing.

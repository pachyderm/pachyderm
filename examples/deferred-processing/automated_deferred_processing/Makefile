# The pipeline uses a timed auth token for authentication.
# The auth token uses a golang duration, which allows h for hours, m for minutes, s for seconds.
# This default is 26 weeks.
# The token will only be valid for this duration if it is *shorter* than the lifetime of the session
# for the user who's logged into the cluster from where this makefile is run.
# See pachctl auth use-auth-token --help for more details.
# If you'd like to experiment with other TTLs, you can customize the value like this:
# env AUTH_TOKEN_TTL=1h make -e create-branch-mover

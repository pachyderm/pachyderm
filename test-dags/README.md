# Test Dags
This folder contains a collection of dags that can be useful for console development. The commands in the `Makefile` will set up interesting dags in a running pachyderm cluster.

## Commands

`setup-datums` - Sets up a dag that is helpful for testing with a large list of datums.

`generate-datums` - Generates datums and commit them to the repo created up in the setup-datums command.

`setup-opencv` - Sets up the openCV getting started tutorial found on our website.
